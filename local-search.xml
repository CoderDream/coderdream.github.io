of a group of Westerners,visiting the Soviet Union.This was in 1987,a few years before the fall of the communist regime.<br>We were given an official tour guide who was assigned to us.<br>And the tour would start in the morning,and we were checked in to our hotel rooms for the night.<br>My friend said to me, ‘’Let’s go outside and look at the city.’’<br>I thought it was a great idea.<br>Dumb idea.<br>So we grabbed our coats, and we snuck out past security and into the street.<br>We found the entrance to the metro.<br>The Moscow underground transportation system is the deepest one in the world.<br>The ride down the escalator took a full minute.<br>Once we were down there, my friend headed right to an open train,and I pulled him back and said, ‘Wait!<br>Let’s write down the name of the station so we can find our way back.’So I had a notepad, and I took a notepad,and I wrote down the letters of the station,and we hopped down the train and went on train hopping.<br>And that was fun because -Well, actually, it was weird.<br>There were a lot of people, probably all coming home from work.<br>They were all dressed in brown and gray clothes,and it looked very, very different from what we were used to at home.<br>But the stations were lovely.<br>There were stations with statues, with paintings on the wall,and glass displays.<br>It was really like museums.<br>We would never have expected that.<br>And everything was perfectly clean.<br>Well,what was weird though is that the people - nobody seemed to speak,and everyone seemed to be looking at us and it kind of weirded us out.<br>So after about 20-30 minutes,we’d had enough and we wanted to go home.<br>I showed my note to someone and they directed me over there.<br>Then over there, I showed my note to another person,and they directed us to the other way.<br>And then a third person directed us sideways.<br>That was a little confusing.<br>Aw, then I saw it.<br>Over the stairs, the sign.<br>It turned out I had written down the Russian word for ‘Exit.’So we headed upstairs and we found a taxi.<br>That was great.<br>And we told the driver, you know, ‘Intourist Hotel,’and then he was willing to take us.<br>And I remember sitting next to the driver, handing him 50 rubles.<br>And he looked at me and he said,(Russian) No, dollar!<br>Fifty dollars?<br>That was like I don’t know 20 times that amount or something.<br>That was not an option for us.<br>So we had to get out of the taxi,and he drove away, leaving us standing there.<br>It was a cold night,and you know everything was strange for us,and we were teenagers,and we were pretty nervous, didn’t know what to do.<br>Well, we started walking.<br>We walked to the end of the block.<br>We turned the corner.<br>And 200 yards in front of us, the Intourist Hotel.Well, this experience affected me in two ways.<br>The first is that anytime after this trip that I would hear anyone speak Russian,I was just cringe.<br>And the second one is that it taught me the importanceof understanding the local language when you’re traveling.<br>And it actually led to me learning another four languages fluentlyover the following years.<br>Now, before I go on, I’d like to know in the audience -Can we have a little bit of light maybe in the audience?<br>I’d just like to know who’s -By a show of hands, who is not a native English speaker?<br>It must be 99%.<br>Anyone who doesn’t speak English, stand up!<br>Alright, so I can assumeall of you have, you know, gone through the process of learning a language.<br>Anybody who speaks three or more languages?<br>Wow, that’s maybe 70%.<br>Four or more languages, anyone?<br>That’s still quite a bit.<br>Anyone speak five or more languages?<br>Wow, come see me during the break.<br>To me, learning a language is…<br>For me, it’s like a deck of playing cards lying faced down on the table.<br>As you start learning and understanding, the cards start opening up for you.<br>Now there’s no standard way of classifying this.<br>But as you learn, you reach certain milestones.<br>And the first one would be when about 25% of the cards are turned up,you reach like a basic level.<br>At this level, you have a base vocabulary, some grammar,and you’re able to have maybe very simple conversationsand communicate a little bit.<br>And your study goes on until you reach this magical point of fluency,what we call being fluent in the language.<br>Now what does it mean, being fluent in a language?<br>It means that you’ve turned up more than 50% of the cards in the deck,and that is the point where you have -where the language becomes part of your subconsciousso that even if you don’t use it anymore for 10 years or longer,you will not forget it.<br>You can get back into it within a very, very short time.<br>So this is a level where you’re comfortable thinking in a language,and comfortable communicating in a language.<br>Now, some people go on and, you know, reach like a mastery level.<br>By that time, you know classic literature in the other languageand have maybe in-depth knowledge of specialized fields.<br>That’s often the point taken in academia.<br>For me, when I learned my first foreign language,I had a head startbecause I was born to a German-speaking mother and an American father.<br>Now, when I was a baby, I didn’t really understandthat what my parents were speaking to me were two separate languages.<br>But by the time I was two years old, I had figured it all out.<br>Women speak only German.Men only speak English.Imagine the fun my parents had when they introduced me to couples.<br>Being a bilingual was actually pretty helpful in learning my first language.<br>It definitely helped.<br>If you’re -But it also gave me something else.<br>It gave me two identities and the ability to switch between them.<br>When you’re a native speaker of more than one language,then your personality, your humor, your value system,they change as you switch languages.<br>This can have huge advantages.<br>I mean, some studies have shown an increased problem-solving abilityor even a higher resistance to Alzheimer’s disease.<br>But what I’m almost interested inis that it’s actually given me a lot of social benefits.<br>When you’re a native speaker,then you feel at home among native speakers or in a culture,and also native speakers accept you as one of theirs.<br>Now is this only relevant to native speakers?<br>And that’s the big question.<br>But wouldn’t it be coolif a person learning a foreign language could actually develop another identityand actually enjoy the social benefits of a native speakerthat go beyond communication skills?<br>Well, that’s what happened to me.<br>I was able to do that,and I want to show you from my experience how I think this can be achieved.<br>So if we say this green area here is the level of the native speaker,the first thing to note is that on your way to reaching fluency,there is not really any shortcut.<br>There are some methods that you can use such as the Burrito Principlewhere you identify 20% of the most effective materials to study.<br>There are some apps, like stuff for time-spaced learning,that increase vocabulary retention.<br>They save a little time,but in the end, there’s no way around working with the material, practicing it,until you reach the fluency level.<br>But the second thing to noteis that going from fluency to mastery is a much slower process,and it requires proportionally more effort.<br>That’s why most people - they just stop at fluency.<br>They know how to speak English, good enough,and they don’t even attempt to venture on,and I can understand it.<br>But the good news is,to get the benefits of a native speaker, at a native-speaker level,you don’t have to go through mastery in the academic sense.<br>In fact, you can skip this step altogether.<br>So if you think about it,there are many native speakers do not have an in-depth knowledgeof specialized fields or sophisticated vocabulary.<br>So, that’s not really what is required.<br>So how do you do it?<br>What is required?<br>Well,I want to give you three areas to focus onwhen you’re learning and interacting with native speakers.<br>The first is: work on eliminating your accent.<br>I’m aware I said eliminating.<br>It should be at least minimizing it.<br>This is, in my opinion, the most overlooked aspectof language learning today,but it’s also the most important oneto reach what I call a native-speaker level or a speaker-like level.<br>If you communicate without an accent or almost without an accent,this changes how natives behave towards you unconsciously,and it also gives you an ability to adapt to a new self-image.<br>The best way that I’ve found -the best exercise I’ve found to improve your pronunciationis what I call the perfect-sentence technique.<br>What you do is you find a native speaker to help you,and you take a book in the foreign language,you open it at a random page,and you read the first sentence.<br>Then, you ask a native speaker to rate youon obvious accent, slight accent, no accent.<br>Then the native speaker will read this sentence back to you.<br>You have to listen carefully and then you repeat.<br>And you repeat this process over and over until the native speaker tells youthat he can no longer hear an accent when you read the sentence.<br>Now, I realize it can take a very long timeeven just to get one sentence right.<br>But I promise youif you are persistent, and if you patiently work on this,you’ll be amazed by what happens to your accent.<br>The second area to focus on is using verbs and expressions that locals use.<br>Now, we all know the situation that vocabulary can be region-specific.<br>Like, in the US, you use ‘stand in line.’In the UK, you ‘queue.’That’s all good.<br>But sometimes, the spoken word is so different,the speech is so different from what you get in textbooks,that the books are almost useless if you want to converse with natives.<br>I want to give you an example.<br>In the French language, there are words like ‘le travail,’which is ‘my work.’A French person talking to his friend would probably say ‘mon boulot,’which is a completely different word.<br>The same for ‘the clothes,’ ‘le vestments,’but you’ll hear ‘le fringues.’Or money is ‘l’argent,’but people say ‘le fric,’ ‘le sou,’ or many other expressions for this.<br>So, obviously I’m only scratching the surface here.<br>But here you actually have to learn all of these words and expressions one by one.<br>And of course, you have to interact with natives to do that.<br>But after you reach a critical mass that you’re comfortable with,it’ll actually be easier when you encounter something new.<br>You’ll just pick it up in one go, like native speakers would,who hear words or expressions that they didn’t know before.<br>The third area to work on is adopting cultural traits.<br>What do I mean by that?<br>So let me ask you:what does this gesture mean to you?<br>Any Italians here?<br>OK, now, depending on what culture you’re from,this could mean something rude,or it could just mean it’s something incredulous,like, ‘Why did you do that?’<br>Or, ‘How could you?’<br>Or it could just be signaling food, ‘Give me food!’<br>Interesting!<br>In the Middle East,this is just a standard way of signaling ‘Please, wait!’<br>So these kind of traits you have to internalize,and sometimes, they’re hard to spot,and it takes a lot of active listening.<br>I want to give you a few more examples.<br>So imagine I am with three of my friends: an American, a German, and a Frenchman.And, like, we’re walking and maybe the American bumps his head,and his initial reaction might be, ‘Ouch!’<br>That’s how you say it in English.But the German that, you know, gets, I don’t know, elbowed in the crowd,he would say, ‘Ow-ah!’<br>And the French person might step on the nail and say, ‘Ay!’<br>So this, of course, in your target language,this is something you have to observe and also internalize,and it has to become part of you.<br>If…<br>Again I’m with these three friends, and I sit with them,and let’s say I serve them tea,and I ask the American, ‘Would you like a biscuit with your tea?’<br>And if he answers in the affirmative, he might say, ‘Uh-huh!’<br>And I can ask the German, ‘Do you know what tea this is?’<br>He’ll say, ‘’Mm- hmm!’’<br>And then I ask the Frenchman, ‘Do you like this?’<br>He’ll say, ‘Hmm!’So these difference, they really require active listening.<br>So all of these three things that I told youwhich is pronunciation,and colloquial speech and adopting cultural traits,they all require that you interact with natives as much as possible.<br>Ideally, you should fully immerse yourself in the culture.<br>Now if you have the chance to live abroad for a while, that will be great.<br>Or maybe live among natives in your hometown.<br>Perhaps just have a romantic relationship,or even just spend time, you know, with co-workers.<br>So, romantic relationships, I could do a whole talk about that.<br>That works really well for these things.<br>But yeah -So this will be different for everybody, of course.<br>But even when you’re not around natives, your learning must not stop.<br>Because what you can do is you can watch TV shows and films,you can mimic the characters,you can write down anything that you haven’t heard of before,and practice that.<br>I also want to encourage you to learn the lyrics of songs.<br>Songs are really great because they tell stories.<br>And they not only help your pronunciation when you sing them,but if they’re emotional,they can anchor these expressions into your active vocabulary.<br>And it’s like speaking all day and really using the expressions unconsciously.<br>It’s a great way.<br>So music, definitely.<br>The other thing you need to move towards native-speaker statusis the right mindset,and a belief that if you sound like a native,express yourself like a native,talk like a native and act like a native,you’ll actually achieve a native-like level.<br>So if I could only leave you with one thing today,it would be: work on your pronunciation.<br>Because pronunciationhelps any stage of the learning process,even in the very beginning.<br>It’ll speed up everything.<br>And it also is the key to reaching a native-speaker level,or almost-native-speaker status.<br>So before I go,I’d like to tell you how I was able to overcome my fear of the Russian language.<br>It was a very, very elegant solution.<br>I married a Russian girl.<br>And I now have little kids in my home that speak Russian to me every day.<br>So I want to thank you.<br>(Applause)<br>And before I go, I just want to wish you(Spanish) A lot of success with your language studies.<br>(French)<br>It was a pleasure to present for you today.<br>(Hebrew)<br>I wish you lots of success with your studies.<br>(Yiddish)<br>Thank you for listening.<br>Good luck to you all and…<br>(Russian)<br>Thank you.<br>(Applause)</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>My story starts in Moscow.I was 15 years old.<br>我的故事从莫斯科开始，当时我15岁。</p><p>My best friend and I, we were part of a group of Westerners,visiting the Soviet Union.This was in 1987,a few years before the fall of the communist regime.<br>我和我最好的朋友，我们是一群西方人的一部分，访问苏联，那是在1987年，共产主义政权垮台前几年。</p><p>We were given an official tour guide who was assigned to us.<br>我们得到了一位分配给我们的官方导游。</p><p>And the tour would start in the morning,and we were checked in to our hotel rooms for the night.<br>旅行将在早上开始，我们被登记入住了我们的酒店房间过夜。</p><p>My friend said to me, ‘’Let’s go outside and look at the city.’’<br>我的朋友对我说，’我们到外面去看看这个城市吧。</p><p>I thought it was a great idea.<br>我认为这是个好主意。</p><p>Dumb idea.<br>愚蠢的想法。</p><p>So we grabbed our coats, and we snuck out past security and into the street.<br>于是，我们拿起外套，偷偷溜出安检，走到街上。</p><p>We found the entrance to the metro.<br>我们找到了地铁的入口。</p><p>The Moscow underground transportation system is the deepest one in the world.<br>莫斯科的地下交通系统是世界上最深的地下交通系统。</p><p>The ride down the escalator took a full minute.<br>乘坐自动扶梯花了整整一分钟。</p><p>Once we were down there, my friend headed right to an open train,and I pulled him back and said, ‘Wait!<br>我们一到那里，我的朋友就直奔一辆敞篷火车，我把他拉回来，说，’等等！</p><p>Let’s write down the name of the station so we can find our way back.’So I had a notepad, and I took a notepad,and I wrote down the letters of the station,and we hopped down the train and went on train hopping.<br>于是我拿了一个记事本，拿了一个记事本，写下了车站的字母，然后我们跳下火车，继续跳火车。</p><p>And that was fun because -Well, actually, it was weird.<br>这很有趣，因为——嗯，实际上，这很奇怪。</p><p>There were a lot of people, probably all coming home from work.<br>有很多人，可能都下班回家了。</p><p>They were all dressed in brown and gray clothes,and it looked very, very different from what we were used to at home.<br>他们都穿着棕色和灰色的衣服，看起来和我们在家里习惯的衣服非常非常不同。</p><p>But the stations were lovely.<br>但是车站很可爱。</p><p>There were stations with statues, with paintings on the wall,and glass displays.<br>有雕像的车站，墙上有画，还有玻璃展示。</p><p>It was really like museums.<br>这真的像博物馆。</p><p>We would never have expected that.<br>我们从未预料到这一点。</p><p>And everything was perfectly clean.<br>一切都很干净。</p><p>Well,what was weird though is that the people - nobody seemed to speak,and everyone seemed to be looking at us and it kind of weirded us out.<br>好吧，奇怪的是，人们似乎没有人说话，每个人似乎都在看着我们，这让我们有点奇怪。</p><p>So after about 20-30 minutes,we’d had enough and we wanted to go home.<br>所以大约20-30分钟后，我们受够了，我们想回家。</p><p>I showed my note to someone and they directed me over there.<br>我把我的纸条给别人看，他们把我带到了那里。</p><p>Then over there, I showed my note to another person,and they directed us to the other way.<br>然后在那里，我把我的纸条给另一个人看，他们把我们引向另一条路。</p><p>And then a third person directed us sideways.<br>然后第三个人把我们引向一边。</p><p>That was a little confusing.<br>这有点令人困惑。</p><p>Aw, then I saw it.<br>噢，然后我看到了。</p><p>Over the stairs, the sign.<br>在楼梯上，标志。</p><p>It turned out I had written down the Russian word for ‘Exit.’So we headed upstairs and we found a taxi.<br>原来我写下了俄语中的“退出”一词，于是我们上楼，找到了一辆出租车。</p><p>That was great.<br>那太好了。</p><p>And we told the driver, you know, ‘Intourist Hotel,’and then he was willing to take us.<br>我们告诉司机，你知道，’Intourist Hotel’，然后他愿意带我们去。</p><p>And I remember sitting next to the driver, handing him 50 rubles.<br>我记得坐在司机旁边，递给他 50 卢布。</p><p>And he looked at me and he said,(Russian) No, dollar!<br>他看着我说，（俄语）不，美元！</p><p>Fifty dollars?<br>五十美元？</p><p>That was like I don’t know 20 times that amount or something.<br>这就像我不知道 20 倍的数量或其他什么。</p><p>That was not an option for us.<br>这对我们来说不是一个选择。</p><p>So we had to get out of the taxi,and he drove away, leaving us standing there.<br>所以我们不得不下车，他开车走了，留下我们站在那里。</p><p>It was a cold night,and you know everything was strange for us,and we were teenagers,and we were pretty nervous, didn’t know what to do.<br>那是一个寒冷的夜晚，你知道对我们来说一切都很奇怪，我们是十几岁的孩子，我们很紧张，不知道该怎么办。</p><p>Well, we started walking.<br>好吧，我们开始走路。</p><p>We walked to the end of the block.<br>我们走到街区的尽头。</p><p>We turned the corner.<br>我们转过了拐角。</p><p>And 200 yards in front of us, the Intourist Hotel.Well, this experience affected me in two ways.<br>在我们前面200码处，Intourist Hotel.嗯，这次经历在两个方面影响了我。</p><p>The first is that anytime after this trip that I would hear anyone speak Russian,I was just cringe.<br>首先，在这次旅行之后的任何时候，我都会听到有人说俄语，我只是畏缩。</p><p>And the second one is that it taught me the importanceof understanding the local language when you’re traveling.<br>第二个是它教会了我在旅行时了解当地语言的重要性。</p><p>And it actually led to me learning another four languages fluentlyover the following years.<br>在接下来的几年里，它实际上使我流利地学习了另外四种语言。</p><p>Now, before I go on, I’d like to know in the audience -Can we have a little bit of light maybe in the audience?<br>现在，在我继续之前，我想知道观众席上——我们能不能在观众席上有一点光？</p><p>I’d just like to know who’s -By a show of hands, who is not a native English speaker?<br>我只想知道谁是 - 通过举手，谁不是以英语为母语的人？</p><p>It must be 99%.<br>它必须是 99%。</p><p>Anyone who doesn’t speak English, stand up!<br>任何不会说英语的人，请站起来！</p><p>Alright, so I can assumeall of you have, you know, gone through the process of learning a language.<br>好吧，我可以假设你们所有人都经历过学习语言的过程。</p><p>Anybody who speaks three or more languages?<br>有人会说三种或三种以上的语言吗？</p><p>Wow, that’s maybe 70%.<br>哇，大概是70%。</p><p>Four or more languages, anyone?<br>四种或更多语言，有人吗？</p><p>That’s still quite a bit.<br>这还是相当多的。</p><p>Anyone speak five or more languages?<br>有人会说五种或更多语言吗？</p><p>Wow, come see me during the break.<br>哇，休息时间来看我。</p><p>To me, learning a language is…<br>对我来说，学习一门语言是……</p><p>For me, it’s like a deck of playing cards lying faced down on the table.<br>对我来说，这就像一副扑克牌面朝下躺在桌子上。</p><p>As you start learning and understanding, the cards start opening up for you.<br>当你开始学习和理解时，卡片开始为你打开。</p><p>Now there’s no standard way of classifying this.<br>现在没有标准的分类方法。</p><p>But as you learn, you reach certain milestones.<br>但随着你的学习，你会达到某些里程碑。</p><p>And the first one would be when about 25% of the cards are turned up,you reach like a basic level.<br>第一个是当大约 25% 的牌被打开时，你达到了一个基本水平。</p><p>At this level, you have a base vocabulary, some grammar,and you’re able to have maybe very simple conversationsand communicate a little bit.<br>在这个级别上，你有一个基本的词汇，一些语法，你能够进行非常简单的对话和交流。</p><p>And your study goes on until you reach this magical point of fluency,what we call being fluent in the language.<br>你的学习会继续下去，直到你达到这个神奇的流利程度，我们称之为流利的语言。</p><p>Now what does it mean, being fluent in a language?<br>那么，流利地使用一门语言意味着什么？</p><p>It means that you’ve turned up more than 50% of the cards in the deck,and that is the point where you have -where the language becomes part of your subconsciousso that even if you don’t use it anymore for 10 years or longer,you will not forget it.<br>这意味着你已经翻出了牌组中超过50%的牌，这就是你拥有的地方——语言成为你潜意识的一部分，所以即使你不再使用它10年或更长时间，你也不会忘记它。</p><p>You can get back into it within a very, very short time.<br>你可以在非常非常短的时间内重新进入它。</p><p>So this is a level where you’re comfortable thinking in a language,and comfortable communicating in a language.<br>所以在这个层面上，你可以自如地用一种语言思考，也自在地用一种语言进行交流。</p><p>Now, some people go on and, you know, reach like a mastery level.<br>现在，有些人继续前进，你知道，达到了精通的水平。</p><p>By that time, you know classic literature in the other languageand have maybe in-depth knowledge of specialized fields.<br>到那时，您已经了解了另一种语言的经典文学，并且可能对专业领域有深入的了解。</p><p>That’s often the point taken in academia.<br>这是学术界经常采取的观点。</p><p>For me, when I learned my first foreign language,I had a head startbecause I was born to a German-speaking mother and an American father.<br>对我来说，当我学习我的第一门外语时，我有一个良好的开端，因为我的母亲说德语，父亲是美国人。</p><p>Now, when I was a baby, I didn’t really understandthat what my parents were speaking to me were two separate languages.<br>现在，当我还是个婴儿的时候，我真的不明白我的父母对我说的是两种不同的语言。</p><p>But by the time I was two years old, I had figured it all out.<br>但到我两岁的时候，我已经想通了。</p><p>Women speak only German. Men only speak English. Imagine the fun my parents had when they introduced me to couples.<br>女人只会说德语，男人只会说英语，想象一下我父母把我介绍给情侣时的乐趣。</p><p>Being a bilingual was actually pretty helpful in learning my first language.<br>作为一个双语者实际上对学习我的第一语言非常有帮助。</p><p>It definitely helped.<br>这绝对有帮助。</p><p>If you’re -But it also gave me something else.<br>如果你是——但它也给了我别的东西。</p><p>It gave me two identities and the ability to switch between them.<br>它给了我两种身份，并能够在它们之间切换。</p><p>When you’re a native speaker of more than one language,then your personality, your humor, your value system,they change as you switch languages.<br>当你的母语是多种语言的人时，你的个性、你的幽默、你的价值体系，它们都会随着你切换语言而改变。</p><p>This can have huge advantages.<br>这可能具有巨大的优势。</p><p>I mean, some studies have shown an increased problem-solving abilityor even a higher resistance to Alzheimer’s disease.<br>我的意思是，一些研究表明，解决问题的能力有所提高，甚至对阿尔茨海默病的抵抗力更高。</p><p>But what I’m almost interested inis that it’s actually given me a lot of social benefits.<br>但我几乎感兴趣的是，它实际上给了我很多社会效益。</p><p>When you’re a native speaker,then you feel at home among native speakers or in a culture,and also native speakers accept you as one of theirs.<br>当你是母语人士时，你会在母语人士或一种文化中感到宾至如归，而且母语人士也接受你作为他们中的一员。</p><p>Now is this only relevant to native speakers?<br>现在，这是否仅与母语人士有关？</p><p>And that’s the big question.<br>这是个大问题。</p><p>But wouldn’t it be coolif a person learning a foreign language could actually develop another identityand actually enjoy the social benefits of a native speakerthat go beyond communication skills?<br>但是，如果一个学习外语的人实际上可以发展出另一种身份，并真正享受母语人士的社会利益，那不是很酷吗？</p><p>Well, that’s what happened to me.<br>嗯，这就是发生在我身上的事情。</p><p>I was able to do that,and I want to show you from my experience how I think this can be achieved.<br>我能够做到这一点，我想从我的经验中向你展示我认为如何实现这一目标。</p><p>So if we say this green area here is the level of the native speaker,the first thing to note is that on your way to reaching fluency,there is not really any shortcut.<br>因此，如果我们说这里的绿色区域是母语人士的水平，首先要注意的是，在达到流利程度的道路上，实际上没有任何捷径。</p><p>There are some methods that you can use such as the Burrito Principlewhere you identify 20% of the most effective materials to study.<br>您可以使用一些方法，例如墨西哥卷饼原则，您可以确定 20% 的最有效材料进行研究。</p><p>There are some apps, like stuff for time-spaced learning,that increase vocabulary retention.<br>有一些应用程序，比如用于时间间隔学习的东西，可以增加词汇量的保留。</p><p>They save a little time,but in the end, there’s no way around working with the material, practicing it,until you reach the fluency level.<br>他们节省了一点时间，但最终，没有办法使用材料，练习它，直到你达到流利的水平。</p><p>But the second thing to noteis that going from fluency to mastery is a much slower process,and it requires proportionally more effort.<br>但第二件需要注意的事情是，从流利到精通是一个缓慢得多的过程，并且需要成比例地付出更多的努力。</p><p>That’s why most people - they just stop at fluency.<br>这就是为什么大多数人 - 他们只是停留在流利度上。</p><p>They know how to speak English, good enough,and they don’t even attempt to venture on,and I can understand it.<br>他们知道如何说英语，足够好，他们甚至不试图冒险，我能理解。</p><p>But the good news is,to get the benefits of a native speaker, at a native-speaker level,you don’t have to go through mastery in the academic sense.<br>但好消息是，要获得母语人士的好处，在母语人士的水平上，您不必经过学术意义上的精通。</p><p>In fact, you can skip this step altogether.<br>事实上，您可以完全跳过此步骤。</p><p>So if you think about it,there are many native speakers do not have an in-depth knowledgeof specialized fields or sophisticated vocabulary.<br>所以如果你仔细想想，有很多母语人士对专业领域或复杂的词汇没有深入的了解。</p><p>So, that’s not really what is required.<br>所以，这并不是真正需要的。</p><p>So how do you do it?<br>那么你是怎么做到的呢？</p><p>What is required?<br>需要什么？</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Well,I want to give you three areas to focus onwhen you’re learning and interacting with native speakers.<br>好吧，我想给你三个方面，当你学习和与母语人士互动时。</p><p>The first is: work on eliminating your accent.<br>首先是：努力消除你的口音。</p><p>I’m aware I said eliminating.<br>我知道我说过消除。</p><p>It should be at least minimizing it.<br>它至少应该最小化它。</p><p>This is, in my opinion, the most overlooked aspectof language learning today,but it’s also the most important oneto reach what I call a native-speaker level or a speaker-like level.<br>在我看来，这是当今语言学习中最容易被忽视的方面，但也是达到我所说的母语水平或类似说话者水平的最重要的方面。</p><p>If you communicate without an accent or almost without an accent,this changes how natives behave towards you unconsciously,and it also gives you an ability to adapt to a new self-image.<br>如果你没有口音或几乎没有口音地交流，这会无意识地改变当地人对你的行为方式，也让你有能力适应新的自我形象。</p><p>The best way that I’ve found -the best exercise I’ve found to improve your pronunciationis what I call the perfect-sentence technique.<br>我发现的最好的方法 - 我发现的改善发音的最佳练习是我所说的完美句子技巧。</p><p>What you do is you find a native speaker to help you,and you take a book in the foreign language,you open it at a random page,and you read the first sentence.<br>你要做的是找一个母语人士来帮助你，然后你拿一本外语的书，你随便翻开一页，然后读第一句话。</p><p>Then, you ask a native speaker to rate youon obvious accent, slight accent, no accent.<br>然后，你让一个母语人士对你的明显口音、轻微口音、无口音进行评分。</p><p>Then the native speaker will read this sentence back to you.<br>然后母语人士会把这句话读给你听。</p><p>You have to listen carefully and then you repeat.<br>你必须仔细听，然后重复。</p><p>And you repeat this process over and over until the native speaker tells youthat he can no longer hear an accent when you read the sentence.<br>你一遍又一遍地重复这个过程，直到母语人士告诉你，当你读这句话时，他再也听不到口音了。</p><p>Now, I realize it can take a very long timeeven just to get one sentence right.<br>现在，我意识到即使只是把一句话说对，也可能需要很长时间。</p><p>But I promise youif you are persistent, and if you patiently work on this,you’ll be amazed by what happens to your accent.<br>但我向你保证，如果你坚持不懈，如果你耐心地努力，你会惊讶于你的口音会发生什么。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The second area to focus on is using verbs and expressions that locals use.<br>第二个需要关注的领域是使用当地人使用的动词和表达方式。</p><p>Now, we all know the situation that vocabulary can be region-specific.<br>现在，我们都知道词汇可以是特定于区域的情况。</p><p>Like, in the US, you use ‘stand in line.’In the UK, you ‘queue.’That’s all good.<br>比如，在美国，你用的是“排队”，在英国，你是“排队”，这都很好。</p><p>But sometimes, the spoken word is so different,the speech is so different from what you get in textbooks,that the books are almost useless if you want to converse with natives.<br>但有时，口语是如此不同，语音与你在教科书上得到的如此不同，如果你想与当地人交谈，这些书几乎毫无用处。</p><p>I want to give you an example.<br>我想给你举个例子。</p><p>In the French language, there are words like ‘le travail,’which is ‘my work.’A French person talking to his friend would probably say ‘mon boulot,’which is a completely different word.<br>在法语中，有像“le travail”这样的词，这是“我的工作”，一个法国人与他的朋友交谈时可能会说“mon boulot”，这是一个完全不同的词。</p><p>The same for ‘the clothes,’ ‘le vestments,’but you’ll hear ‘le fringues.’Or money is ‘l’argent,’but people say ‘le fric,’ ‘le sou,’ or many other expressions for this.<br>“衣服”、“法衣”也是如此，但你会听到“le fringues”，或者钱是“l’argent”，但人们会说“le fric”、“le sou”或许多其他表达方式。</p><p>So, obviously I’m only scratching the surface here.<br>所以，显然我只是在这里触及了表面。</p><p>But here you actually have to learn all of these words and expressions one by one.<br>但在这里，你实际上必须一个接一个地学习所有这些单词和表达方式。</p><p>And of course, you have to interact with natives to do that.<br>当然，你必须与当地人互动才能做到这一点。</p><p>But after you reach a critical mass that you’re comfortable with,it’ll actually be easier when you encounter something new.<br>但是在你达到一个你觉得舒服的临界质量之后，当你遇到新事物时，它实际上会更容易。</p><p>You’ll just pick it up in one go, like native speakers would,who hear words or expressions that they didn’t know before.<br>你只需一口气拿起它，就像母语人士一样，他们会听到他们以前不知道的单词或表达方式。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The third area to work on is adopting cultural traits.<br>第三个工作领域是采用文化特征。</p><p>What do I mean by that?<br>我这是什么意思？</p><p>So let me ask you:what does this gesture mean to you?<br>那么让我问你：这个姿态对你来说意味着什么？</p><p>Any Italians here?<br>这里有意大利人吗？</p><p>OK, now, depending on what culture you’re from,this could mean something rude,or it could just mean it’s something incredulous,like, ‘Why did you do that?’<br>好吧，现在，根据你来自什么文化，这可能意味着一些粗鲁的事情，或者它可能只是意味着一些难以置信的事情，比如，“你为什么要这样做？</p><p>Or, ‘How could you?’<br>“或者，”你怎么能？</p><p>Or it could just be signaling food, ‘Give me food!’<br>或者它可能只是在向食物发出信号，“给我食物！</p><p>Interesting!<br>有趣！</p><p>In the Middle East,this is just a standard way of signaling ‘Please, wait!’<br>在中东，这只是一种标准的信号方式，“请稍等！</p><p>So these kind of traits you have to internalize,and sometimes, they’re hard to spot,and it takes a lot of active listening.<br>所以这些特质你必须内化，有时，它们很难被发现，这需要大量的积极倾听。</p><p>I want to give you a few more examples.<br>我想再举几个例子。</p><p>So imagine I am with three of my friends: an American, a German, and a Frenchman.And, like, we’re walking and maybe the American bumps his head,and his initial reaction might be, ‘Ouch!’<br>想象一下，我和我的三个朋友在一起：一个美国人，一个德国人，一个法国人。</p><p>That’s how you say it in English.But the German that, you know, gets, I don’t know, elbowed in the crowd,he would say, ‘Ow-ah!’<br>但是，你知道，德国人，我不知道，在人群中肘击，他会说，’噢，啊！</p><p>And the French person might step on the nail and say, ‘Ay!’<br>法国人可能会踩到钉子说，’哎呀！</p><p>So this, of course, in your target language,this is something you have to observe and also internalize,and it has to become part of you.<br>所以，当然，在你的目标语言中，这是你必须观察和内化的东西，它必须成为你的一部分。</p><p>If…<br>如果。。。</p><p>Again I’m with these three friends, and I sit with them,and let’s say I serve them tea,and I ask the American, ‘Would you like a biscuit with your tea?’<br>我又一次和这三个朋友在一起，我和他们坐在一起，假设我给他们端茶，我问美国人，“你想在茶里吃饼干吗？</p><p>And if he answers in the affirmative, he might say, ‘Uh-huh!’<br>如果他的回答是肯定的，他可能会说，“嗯！</p><p>And I can ask the German, ‘Do you know what tea this is?’<br>我可以问德国人，’你知道这是什么茶吗？</p><p>He’ll say, ‘’Mm- hmm!’’<br>他会说，’嗯——嗯！</p><p>And then I ask the Frenchman, ‘Do you like this?’<br>然后我问法国人，’你喜欢这个吗？</p><p>He’ll say, ‘Hmm!’So these difference, they really require active listening.<br>他会说，’嗯！’所以这些差异，它们真的需要积极倾听。</p><p>So all of these three things that I told youwhich is pronunciation,and colloquial speech and adopting cultural traits,they all require that you interact with natives as much as possible.<br>所以我告诉你的这三件事，即发音、口语和采用文化特征，它们都要求你尽可能多地与当地人互动。</p><p>Ideally, you should fully immerse yourself in the culture.<br>理想情况下，您应该完全沉浸在文化中。</p><p>Now if you have the chance to live abroad for a while, that will be great.<br>现在，如果您有机会在国外生活一段时间，那就太好了。</p><p>Or maybe live among natives in your hometown.<br>或者也许住在你家乡的当地人中间。</p><p>Perhaps just have a romantic relationship,or even just spend time, you know, with co-workers.<br>也许只是有一段浪漫的关系，甚至只是花时间，你知道，和同事在一起。</p><p>So, romantic relationships, I could do a whole talk about that.<br>所以，恋爱关系，我可以做一个完整的讨论。</p><p>That works really well for these things.<br>这对于这些事情非常有效。</p><p>But yeah -So this will be different for everybody, of course.<br>但是，是的 - 所以当然，这对每个人来说都是不同的。</p><p>But even when you’re not around natives, your learning must not stop.<br>但即使你不在当地人身边，你的学习也不能停止。</p><p>Because what you can do is you can watch TV shows and films,you can mimic the characters,you can write down anything that you haven’t heard of before,and practice that.<br>因为你能做的就是看电视节目和电影，你可以模仿角色，你可以写下任何你以前没有听说过的东西，然后练习。</p><p>I also want to encourage you to learn the lyrics of songs.<br>我还想鼓励你学习歌曲的歌词。</p><p>Songs are really great because they tell stories.<br>歌曲真的很棒，因为它们会讲故事。</p><p>And they not only help your pronunciation when you sing them,but if they’re emotional,they can anchor these expressions into your active vocabulary.<br>当你唱歌时，它们不仅有助于你的发音，而且如果他们是情绪化的，它们可以将这些表达锚定到你的活跃词汇中。</p><p>And it’s like speaking all day and really using the expressions unconsciously.<br>这就像整天说话，真的在不知不觉中使用这些表达方式。</p><p>It’s a great way.<br>这是一个很好的方法。</p><p>So music, definitely.<br>所以音乐，绝对是。</p><p>The other thing you need to move towards native-speaker statusis the right mindset,and a belief that if you sound like a native,express yourself like a native,talk like a native and act like a native,you’ll actually achieve a native-like level.<br>迈向母语人士地位的另一件事是正确的心态，以及一种信念，即如果你听起来像母语，像母语一样表达自己，像母语一样说话，像母语一样行事，你实际上会达到类似母语的水平。</p><p>So if I could only leave you with one thing today,it would be: work on your pronunciation.<br>因此，如果我今天只能留给你一件事，那就是：努力提高你的发音。</p><p>Because pronunciationhelps any stage of the learning process,even in the very beginning.<br>因为发音有助于学习过程的任何阶段，即使是在一开始。</p><p>It’ll speed up

They can all be used at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence.  “Although”， “even though”， “in spite of” 和 “despite”都用于连接两个相反的想法或表明一个事实使另一个事实令人惊讶。它们都可以用在句子的开头或中间。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Despite</strong> the rain, we enjoyed the festival.</em>  尽管下着雨，我们还是很享受这个节日。<br><em>We enjoyed the festival, <strong>despite</strong> the rain.</em>  尽管下着雨，我们还是很享受这个节日。</p></blockquote><p>The main difference between <em>although</em>, <em>even though</em>, <em>in spite of</em> and <em>despite</em> is that they are used with different structures. “Although”， “even though”， “in spite of” 和 “despite”之间的主要区别在于它们使用不同的结构。</p><h4 id="in-spite-of-despite-“in-spite-of”-和-“despite”"><a href="#in-spite-of-despite-“in-spite-of”-和-“despite”" class="headerlink" title="in spite of &#x2F; despite-“in spite of” 和 “despite”"></a><em>in spite of</em> &#x2F; <em>despite</em>-“in spite of” 和 “despite”</h4><p>After <em>in spite of</em> and <em>despite</em>, we use a noun, gerund (-<em>ing</em> form of a verb) or a pronoun. 在“in spite of” 和 “despite”之后，我们使用名词、动名词（动词的-ing形式）或代词。</p><blockquote><p><em>They never made much money, <strong>in spite of</strong> their success.</em>  尽管他们取得了成功，但他们从未赚过多少钱。<br><em><strong>In spite of</strong> the pain in his leg, he completed the marathon.</em>  尽管腿很痛，他还是完成了马拉松比赛。<br><em><strong>Despite</strong> having a headache, I had a great birthday.</em>  尽管头疼，我还是度过了一个愉快的生日。<br><em>The train was cancelled. <strong>In spite of</strong> that, we arrived on time.</em>  火车被取消了。尽管如此，我们还是准时到达了。</p></blockquote><p>Note that it is common to use <em>in spite of</em> and <em>despite</em> with the expression <em>the fact that</em>, followed by a subject and verb.  请注意，通常“in spite of” 和 “despite”与<em>the fact that</em>一起使用时，后跟主语和动词。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>In spite of the fact that</strong> he worked very hard, he didn’t pass the exam.</em>  尽管他非常努力，但他还是没有通过考试。<br><em><strong>Despite the fact that</strong> he worked very hard, he didn’t pass the exam.</em>  尽管他非常努力，但他还是没有通过考试。</p></blockquote><h4 id="although-even-though-尽管-尽管"><a href="#although-even-though-尽管-尽管" class="headerlink" title="although &#x2F; even though-尽管&#x2F;尽管"></a><em>although</em> &#x2F; <em>even though</em>-尽管&#x2F;尽管</h4><p>After <em>although</em> and <em>even though</em>, we use a subject and a verb. <em>Even though</em> is slightly stronger and more emphatic than <em>although</em>.  在“although”和“even though”之后，我们使用主语和动词。 “Even though”比“although”稍强、更强调。</p><blockquote><p><em>I enjoyed the course, <strong>although</strong> I would have liked more grammar practice.</em>  我很喜欢这门课程，尽管我希望有更多的语法练习。<br><em><strong>Although</strong> we saw each other every day, we didn’t really know each other.</em>  虽然我们每天都见面，但我们并不真正了解对方。<br><em><strong>Even though</strong> she spoke very quietly, he understood every word.</em>  虽然她说得很小声，但他却听懂了每一个字。<br><em>She didn’t get the job, <strong>even though</strong> she had all the necessary qualifications.</em>  尽管她具备所有必要的资格，但她没有得到这份工作。</p></blockquote><h4 id="though-尽管"><a href="#though-尽管" class="headerlink" title="though-尽管"></a><em>though</em>-尽管</h4><p><em>Though</em> can be used in the same way as <em>although</em>. “Though”的用法与 “although”相同。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Though</strong> I wasn’t keen on the film, I thought the music was beautiful.</em>  虽然我不喜欢这部电影，但我觉得音乐很美。</p></blockquote><p><em>Though</em> can also go at the end of the second phrase. This way of expressing contrasting ideas is most common in spoken English.  “Though” 也可以放在第二个短语的末尾。这种表达对比思想的方式在英语口语中最常见。</p><blockquote><p><em>We waited ages for our food. The waiter was really nice, <strong>though</strong>.</em>  我们等了很长时间才等到我们的食物。不过服务员真的很好。</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="‘in-spite-of’-‘despite’-‘although’-‘even-though’-and-‘though’-2"><a href="#‘in-spite-of’-‘despite’-‘although’-‘even-though’-and-‘though’-2" class="headerlink" title="‘in spite of’, ‘despite’, ‘although’, ‘even though’ and ‘though’: 2"></a>‘in spite of’, ‘despite’, ‘although’, ‘even though’ and ‘though’: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct option to complete the sentences.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>We decided to buy the house, _____ we didn’t really have enough money.<br>despite<br>in spite of<br>even though</li><li>_____ my careful planning, we ended up staying in a really bad hotel.<br>Despite<br>Although<br>Even though</li><li>My partner snores really loudly but _____ that I sleep well.<br>even though<br>in spite of<br>although</li><li>You keep making that stupid noise _____ I’ve asked you to stop three times.<br>despite<br>in spite of<br>even though</li><li>I won the race _____ coming last in the practice run.<br>although<br>in spite of<br>even though</li><li>You told me ten times.

Regular past simple verbs have -<em>ed</em> at the end (e.g. <em>called</em>, <em>played</em>, <em>arrived</em>). Irregular verbs have a different form, usually with a different vowel sound (e.g. <em>wake</em> → <em>woke</em>, <em>break</em> → <em>broke</em>, <em>feel</em> → <em>felt</em>).一般过去时向我们表明某个动作是过去发生的，而不是现在发生的。常规一般过去动词末尾有 -ed（例如，叫、玩、到达）。不规则动词有不同的形式，通常具有不同的元音（例如wake→wake、break→broken、feel→feeled）。</p><blockquote><p><em>My parents called me yesterday.</em> 我的父母昨天给我打电话。<br><em>I woke up early this morning.</em> 我今天早上很早就醒了。<br><em>Sam played basketball when he was at university.</em> 萨姆在大学时打篮球。</p></blockquote><p>We make the negative with <em>didn’t</em> and the infinitive verb.我们用 did not 和不定式动词构成否定形式。</p><blockquote><p><em>My parents didn’t call me yesterday.</em> 昨天我父母没有给我打电话。<br><em>I didn’t wake up early this morning.</em> 今天早上我没有早起。</p></blockquote><p>We make the question form with <em>did</em> and then the subject and infinitive verb.我们用 did 来构成疑问句，然后是主语和不定式动词。</p><blockquote><p><em>Did you wake up early this morning?</em> 今天早上你起得很早吗？<br><em>Did Sam play basketball when he was at university?</em> 萨姆在大学时打篮球吗？</p></blockquote><h4 id="Past-continuous过去进行时"><a href="#Past-continuous过去进行时" class="headerlink" title="Past continuous过去进行时"></a>Past continuous过去进行时</h4><p>The past continuous shows us that the action was already in progress at a certain time in the past.过去进行时向我们表明该动作在过去的某个时间已经在进行中。</p><blockquote><p><em>What were you doing at 8 p.m. last night?</em> 昨夜晚上八点你在做什么？<br><em>I was studying.</em> 我那时正在学习。</p></blockquote><p>This means that I started studying before 8 p.m. and I continued after 8 p.m.这意味着我晚上8点之前就开始学习了。晚上 8 点后我继续。</p><p>The past continuous can also show that an activity was in progress for some time, not just for a moment.过去进行时也可以表明一项活动已经进行了一段时间，而不仅仅是一会儿。</p><blockquote><p><em>We were cleaning the house all morning.</em> 我们整个早上都在打扫房子。</p></blockquote><p>We make the past continuous with <em>was</em> or <em>were</em> and the -<em>ing</em> form of the verb.我们用 was 或 were 以及动词的 -ing 形式使过去进行时。</p><blockquote><p><em>She couldn’t come to the party. She was working.</em> 她不能来参加聚会。她正在工作。<br><em>Three years ago, we were living in my home town.</em> 三年前，我们住在我的家乡。<br><em>I tried to give him some advice, but he wasn’t listening.</em> 我试图给他一些建议，但他不听。<br><em>What were you doing this time last year?</em> 去年这个时候你在做什么？</p></blockquote><h4 id="Past-continuous-and-past-simple过去进行时和一般过去时"><a href="#Past-continuous-and-past-simple过去进行时和一般过去时" class="headerlink" title="Past continuous and past simple过去进行时和一般过去时"></a>Past continuous and past simple过去进行时和一般过去时</h4><p>When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the past simple action happened in the middle of the past continuous action, while it was in progress.当我们同时使用这两个时态时，它表明过去的简单动作发生在过去的连续动作的中间，并且正在进行。</p><blockquote><p><em>While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy.</em> 正当我学习的时候，我突然感到困了。</p></blockquote><p>We often use these tenses to show an action interrupting another action.我们经常使用这些时态来表示一个动作打断另一个动作。</p><blockquote><p><em>I broke my leg when I was skiing.</em> 我滑雪时摔断了腿。<br><em>As I was going to work, I saw an old friend.</em> 当我去上班的时候，我见到了一位老朋友。<br><em>We were watching television when the power went off.</em> 我们正在看电视，突然停电了。</p></blockquote><p>Can you see a difference in the meaning of these two sentences?你能看出这两句话的意思有什么不同吗？</p><blockquote><p><em>When the guests arrived, Jane was cooking dinner.</em> 客人到来时，简正在做饭。<br><em>When the guests arrived, Jane cooked dinner.</em> 客人到来后，简做饭了。</p></blockquote><p>In the first one, Jane started cooking dinner before the guests arrived. We know that because it uses the past continuous. In the second sentence, the guests arrived first and then Jane started cooking.第一个场景中，简在客人到来之前开始做饭。我们知道这一点是因为它使用了过去进行时。第二句话，客人先到了，然后简然开始做饭。</p><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Past-continuous-and-past-simple-2"><a href="#Past-continuous-and-past-simple-2" class="headerlink" title="Past continuous and past simple: 2"></a>Past continuous and past simple: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct verb tense.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>I _____ my new job yesterday.<br>started<br>was starting</li><li>What _____ at around 8 a.m. this morning?<br>did you do<br>were you doing</li><li>While I was washing the dishes, I suddenly _____ a brilliant idea.<br>had<br>was having</li><li>He didn’t hear the phone ring.

So, we say:我们通常不会用冠词来表示各大洲、大多数国家、城市、城镇、湖泊、山脉或大学。所以，我们说：</p><blockquote><p><em>Africa, Asia, Europe非洲、亚洲、欧洲<br>India, Ghana, Peru, Denmark印度、加纳、秘鲁、丹麦<br>Addis Ababa, Hanoi, New York, Moscow亚的斯亚贝巴、河内、纽约、莫斯科<br>Lake Victoria, Lake Superior, Lake Tanganyika维多利亚湖、苏必利尔湖、坦噶尼喀湖<br>Mount Everest, Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Elbrus珠穆朗玛峰、乞力马扎罗山、厄尔布鲁士山<br>Cardiff University, Harvard University, Manchester University卡迪夫大学、哈佛大学、曼彻斯特大学</em></p></blockquote><p>Some countries are different.

There are no grammatical rules for which preposition is used with which adjective, so it’s a good idea to try to learn them together. To help you do this, write new vocabulary in your notebook in a sentence or phrase.有些形容词与某些介词搭配。介词与形容词的使用没有语法规则，因此最好尝试一起学习它们。为了帮助您做到这一点，请在笔记本上用句子或短语写下新词汇。</p><p>However, there are some patterns that can help you. Let’s look at them first. Remember that a preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (<em>-ing</em> form).但是，有一些模式可以帮助您。我们先来看看它们。请记住，介词后跟名词或动名词（-ing 形式）。</p><h4 id="With-at-使用at"><a href="#With-at-使用at" class="headerlink" title="With at 使用at"></a>With <em>at</em> 使用at</h4><p>We use <em>at</em> with adjectives like <em>good</em>&#x2F;<em>bad</em>&#x2F;<em>amazing</em>&#x2F;<em>brilliant</em>&#x2F;<em>terrible</em>, etc. to talk about skills and abilities.我们将 at 与好&#x2F;坏&#x2F;惊人&#x2F;辉煌&#x2F;可怕等形容词一起使用来谈论技能和能力。</p><blockquote><p><em>He’s really <strong>good at</strong> English.他英语真的很好。<br>She’s <strong>amazing at</strong> the piano.她的钢琴弹得很棒。<br>They’re <strong>terrible at</strong> organising anything.他们不擅长组织任何事情。<br>I’m not very <strong>good at</strong> drawing.我不太擅长画画。</em></p></blockquote><h4 id="With-about-使用about"><a href="#With-about-使用about" class="headerlink" title="With about 使用about"></a>With <em>about</em> 使用about</h4><p>We often use <em>about</em> with adjectives of feelings like <em>angry</em>&#x2F;<em>excited</em>&#x2F;<em>happy</em>&#x2F;<em>nervous</em>&#x2F;<em>sad</em>&#x2F;<em>stressed</em>&#x2F;<em>worried</em>, etc. to explain what is causing that feeling.我们经常将 about 与表示感觉的形容词一起使用，例如愤怒&#x2F;兴奋&#x2F;快乐&#x2F;紧张&#x2F;悲伤&#x2F;压力&#x2F;担心等来解释是什么导致了这种感觉。</p><blockquote><p><em>I’m <strong>angry about</strong> the decision.我对这个决定感到愤怒。<br>He’s <strong>nervous about</strong> the presentation.他对演讲感到紧张。<br>She’s <strong>excited about</strong> the new job.她对新工作感到很兴奋。<br>They were <strong>worried about</strong> the exam.他们很担心考试。</em></p></blockquote><h4 id="With-of-使用of"><a href="#With-of-使用of" class="headerlink" title="With of 使用of"></a>With <em>of</em> 使用of</h4><p>However, sometimes we use <em>of</em> with feelings.然而，有时我们会用of来表达感情。</p><blockquote><p><em>She was

to show the connection between people or things.我们可以用 to 来表示人或事物之间的联系。</p><blockquote><p><em>He’s <strong>married to</strong> the director.他和导演结婚了。<br>I’m <strong>addicted to</strong> my phone.我对手机上瘾了。<br>I’m <strong>allergic to</strong> nuts.我对坚果过敏。<br>It’s <strong>similar to</strong> the old one.这和旧的很相似。</em></p></blockquote><p>We can also use <em>to</em> to talk about someone’s behaviour towards someone else.我们还可以使用 to 来谈论某人对其他人的行为。</p><blockquote><p><em>They were really <strong>friendly to</strong> me.他们对我真的很友好。<br>Was he <strong>nice to</strong> you?他对你好吗？<br>He is always <strong>polite to</strong> everyone.他对每个人总是很有礼貌。<br>She was very <strong>rude to</strong> the waitress.她对女服务员非常粗鲁。</em></p></blockquote><p>Here are some other useful adjectives with prepositions.这里有一些其他有用的带有介词的形容词。</p><h4 id="With-for使用for"><a href="#With-for使用for" class="headerlink" title="With for使用for"></a>With <em>for</em>使用for</h4><blockquote><p><em>Exercise is <strong>good

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="\assets\css\APlayer.min.css"><script src="\assets\js\APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><h2 id="【C1-Listening】Bad-Smells-in-Code-代码里的坏味道"><a href="#【C1-Listening】Bad-Smells-in-Code-代码里的坏味道" class="headerlink" title="【C1-Listening】Bad Smells in Code-代码里的坏味道"></a>【C1-Listening】Bad Smells in Code-代码里的坏味道</h2><blockquote><p>Chapter 3: Bad Smells in Code<br>“If it stinks, change it.”</p><p>— Grandma Beck, discussing child raising philosophy By now you have a good idea of how refactoring works. But just because you know how doesn’t mean you know when. Deciding when to start refactoring (and when to stop) is just as important to refactoring as knowing how to operate the mechanics of a refactoring.</p><p>Now comes the dilemma. It is easy to explain to you how to delete an instance variable or create a hierarchy. These are simple matters. Trying to explain when you should do these things is not so cut-anddried. Rather than appealing to some vague notion of programming aesthetics (which frankly is what we consultants usually do) I wanted something a bit more solid.</p><p>I was mulling over this tricky issue when I visited Kent in Zurich. Perhaps he was under the influence of the odors of his new born daughter at the time, but he had come up with the notion describing the “when” of refactoring in terms of smells. “Smells,” you say, “and that is supposed to be better than vague aesthetics?” Well, yes. We look at lots of code, written by projects that span the gamut from wildly successful to nearly dead. And in doing so, we have learned to look for certain structures in the code that suggest (sometimes they scream for) the possibility of refactoring. (We are switching over to “we” in this chapter to reflect the fact that Kent and I wrote this chapter jointly. You can tell the difference because the funny jokes are mine and the others are his.)</p><p>One thing we won’t try to do here is give you precise criteria for when a refactoring is overdue. In our experience there is no set of metrics that rival informed human intuition. What we will do is give you indications that there is trouble that could be solved by a refactoring. You will have to develop your own sense of how many instance variables is too many instance variables and how many lines of code in a method is too many lines.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Duplicated-code"><a href="#Duplicated-code" class="headerlink" title="Duplicated code"></a>Duplicated code</h3><blockquote><p>Number one on the stink parade is duplicated code. If you see the same code structure in more than one place, you can be sure that your program will be better if you find a way to unify them.</p><p>The simplest duplicated code problem is when you have the same expression in two methods of the same class. Then all you have to do is Extract Method (114) and invoke the code from both places.</p><p>Another common duplication problem is when you have the same expression in two sibling subclasses. You can eliminate this duplication by using Extract Method (114) in both classes, then Pull Up Method (271). If the code is similar but not the same, then you need to use Extract Method (114) to separate the similar bits from the different bits.</p><p>You may then find you can use Form Template Method (289). If the methods do the same thing using a different algorithm, you can choose the clearer of the two algorithms and use Substitute Algorithm (132).</p><p>If you have duplicated code in two unrelated classes, consider using Extract Component (166) in one class, and then use the new component in the other. Another possibility is that the method really belongs only in one of the classes and should be invoked by the other class, or that the method belongs in a third class that should be referred to by both of the original classes. You have to decide where the method makes sense, and ensure it is there and nowhere else.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Long-method"><a href="#Long-method" class="headerlink" title="Long method"></a>Long method</h3><blockquote><p>The object programs that live best and longest are those with short methods. Programmers new to objects often get the feeling that no computation ever takes place, that object programs are endless sequences of delegation. When you have lived with a program for a few years, however, you learn just how valuable all those little methods are. All of the pay-offs of indirection- explanation, sharing, and choosing- are supported by little methods.</p><p>Since the early days of programming people have realized that the longer a procedure is, the more difficult it is to understand. Older languages carried an overhead in subroutine calls, which deterred people from small method, modern OO languages have pretty much eliminated that overhead. There is still an overhead to the reader of the code as you have to switch context to look and see what the sub-procedure does. Development environments that allow you to see two methods at once help to eliminate this; but the real key to making it easy to understand small methods is good naming. If you have a good name for a method you don’t need to look at the body.</p><p>The net effect of this is that you should be much more aggressive about decomposing methods. A heuristic we follow is whenever we feel the need to comment something, we instead write a method. Such a method contains the code that was commented, but is named after what the intention of the code is, rather than how it does it. We may do this on a group of lines, or on as small as a single line of code. We will do this even if the method call is longer than the code it replaces, providing the method name explains the purpose of the code. The key here is not the method length, but the semantic distance between what the method does and how it does it.</p><p>99% of the time, all you have to shorten a method is Extract Method (114). Find a part of the method that seems to go nicely together and make a new method.</p><p>If you have a method with lots of parameters and temporary variables, they get in the way of extracting methods. If you try to use Extract Method, you end up passing so many of the parameters and temporary variables as parameters to the extracted method that the result is scarcely more readable than the original. You can often use Inline Temp (121) to get rid of the temps. Long lists of parameters can be slimmed down with Introduce Parameter Object (247) and Preserve Whole Object (241).</p><p>If you’ve tried that, and you still have too many temps and parameters,<br>then it’s time to get out the heavy artillery: Replace Method with Method Object (130).</p><p>How do you identify the clumps of code to extract? A good technique is to look for comments. They often signal this kind of semantic distance.</p><p>A block of code with a comment that tells you what it is doing can be replaced by a method whose name is based on the comment.</p><p>Even a single line is worth extracting if it needs explanation.</p><p>Conditionals and loops also give signs for extractions. Use Decompose Conditional (136) to deal with conditional expressions. With loops extract the loop and the code within the loop into its own method.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Large-Class"><a href="#Large-Class" class="headerlink" title="Large Class"></a>Large Class</h3><blockquote><p>When a class is trying to do too much, it often shows up as too many instance variables. When a class has too many instance variables, duplicated code cannot be far behind.</p><p>You can Extract Component (166) to bundle up a number of the variables.</p><p>Choose variables to go together in the component that makes sense with each other. For example, “depositAmount” and “deposit-Currency” are likely to belong together in a component. More generally, common prefixes or suffixes for some subset of the variables in a class suggest the opportunity for a component. If the component makes sense as a subclass you’ll find Extract Subclass (277) often is easier.</p><p>However you can only do this if the subset of instance variables that are used do not change during an object’s lifetime.</p><p>Sometimes a class will not be using all of its instance variables all of the time. If so, you may be able to Extract Component (166) or Extract Subclass (277) many times.</p><p>As with a class with too many instance variables, a class with too much code is prime breeding ground for duplicated code, chaos, and death.</p><p>The simplest solution (have we mentioned that we like simple solutions?)</p><p>is if you can eliminate redundancy in the class itself. If you have five hundred line methods with lots of code in common, you may be able to turn them into five ten line methods with another ten two line methods extracted from the original.</p><p>As with a class with a huge wad of variables, the usual solution for a class with too much code is either to Extract Component (166) or Extract Subclass (277).</p></blockquote><h3 id="Long-Parameter-List"><a href="#Long-Parameter-List" class="headerlink" title="Long Parameter List"></a>Long Parameter List</h3><blockquote><p>In our early programming days we were taught to pass everything a routine needed in as parameters. This was understandable because the alternative was global data, and global data is evil and usually painful.</p><p>Objects change this situation because if you don’t have something you need, you can always ask another object to get it for you. Thus with objects you don’t pass in everything the method needs, instead you pass enough so that the method can get to everything it needs. A lot of what a method needs is available on method’s host class. Thus in object-oriented programs parameter lists tend to be much smaller than on traditional programs.</p><p>This is good because long parameter lists are hard to understand, they get inconsistent and difficult to use, and because you are forever changing them as you need more data. Most changes are removed by passing objects because you are much more likely to just need to make a couple of requests to get at a new piece of data.</p><p>Use Replace Parameter with Method (245) when you can get the data in one parameter by making a request of an object you already know about. This object might be a field or it might be another parameter.</p><p>Use Preserve Whole Object (241) to take a bunch of data gleaned from an object and replace it with the object itself. If you have several data items with no logical object, then Introduce Parameter Object (247).</p><p>There is one important exception to doing these changes. This is when you explicitly do not wish to create a dependency from the called object to the larger object. In those cases unpacking data and sending it along as parameters is reasonable, but pay attention to the pain involved. If the parameter list is too long or changes too often you will need to rethink your dependency structure.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Divergent-Change"><a href="#Divergent-Change" class="headerlink" title="Divergent Change"></a>Divergent Change</h3><blockquote><p>We structure our software to make change easier, after all software is meant to be soft. So when we make a change we want to be able to jump to a single clear point in the system and make the change.</p><p>If you look at a class and say, “Well, I will have to change these three methods every time I get a new database. I have to change these four methods every time there is a new financial instrument.” you likely have a situation where two objects are better than one. Of course you often discover this only after you’ve added a few databases or financial instruments. Any change to handle a variation should change a single class and all the typing in the new class should be expressing the variation.</p><p>So for this you identify those things you are changing and use Extract Component (166) to put them all together.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Shotgun-Surgery"><a href="#Shotgun-Surgery" class="headerlink" title="Shotgun Surgery"></a>Shotgun Surgery</h3><blockquote><p>You whiff this when every time you add some variation, you have to make a lot of little changes to a lot of different classes. When the changes are all over the place, they are hard to find, and it’s easy to miss an important change. In this case you want to use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) to get all the changes into a single class. If no current class looks like a good candidate, then create one. Often you can use Inline Component (170) to bring a whole bunch of behavior together. You then get a small dose of Divergent Change, but you can easily deal with that.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Feature-Envy"><a href="#Feature-Envy" class="headerlink" title="Feature Envy"></a>Feature Envy</h3><blockquote><p>The whole point of objects is that they are a packaging technique that packages data together with the processes upon that data. A classic smell is thus a method that seems more interested in another class than the one it’s actually in. The most common focus of the envy is the data.</p><p>We’ve lost count of the times we’ve seen a method that invokes half-adozen getting methods on another object in order to calculate some value. Fortunately the cure is obvious, the method clearly wants to be elsewhere so you use Move Method (160) to get it there. Sometimes only part of the method suffers from envy, in that case use Extract Method (114) on the jealous bit and then Move Method (160) to give it a dream home.</p><p>Of course not all cases are so cut and dried. Often a method uses features of several classes, so which one should it live with? The heuristic we use is to which class has most of the data and put the method with that data. This is often made easier by using Extract Method (114) to break into methods that go into different places.</p><p>Of course there several sophisticated patterns that break this rule.</p><p>From the [Gang of Four] Strategy and Visitor immediately leap to mind. Kent’s Self Delegation is another. You do these to combat the Divergent Change smell. The fundamental rule of thumb is to put things together that change together. Data and the behavior that references that data usually change together, but there are exceptions.</p><p>When those exceptions occur we move the behavior to keep changes in one place. Strategy and Visitor allow you to change behavior easily because it isolates the small amount of behavior that needs to be overridden, at the cost of further indirection.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Data-Clumps"><a href="#Data-Clumps" class="headerlink" title="Data Clumps"></a>Data Clumps</h3><blockquote><p>Data items tend to be like children — they enjoy hanging around in groups together. Often you’ll see the same three or four data items together in lots of places: fields in a couple of classes, parameters in many method signatures. Bunches of data that hang around together really ought to be made into their own object. The first step is to look for where they appear as fields. Use Extract Component (166) on the fields to turn them into an object. Then turn your attention to method signatures, using Introduce Parameter Object (247) or Preserve Whole Object (241) to slim them down. The immediate benefit here is that you can shrink a lot of parameter lists and make method calling a lot simpler.</p><p>Don’t worry about data clumps that only use some of the fields of the new object. As long as you are replacing a couple or more fields with the new object, you’ll come out ahead.</p><p>A good test is to consider deleting one of the data values: if you did this would the others make any sense? If they don’t that’s a sure sign that you have an object that’s dying to be born.</p><p>Reducing field lists and parameter lists will certainly remove a few bad smells, but once you have the objects you get the opportunity to make a nice perfume. You can now look for cases of Divergent Change which will suggest behavior that can be moved into your new classes.</p><p>Before long these classes will be productive members of society.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Case-Statements"><a href="#Case-Statements" class="headerlink" title="Case Statements"></a>Case Statements</h3><blockquote><p>One of the most obvious symptoms of object-oriented code is its lack of case (or switch) statements. The problem with case statements is essentially that of duplication. Often you find the same case statement scattered about a program for different purposes. If you add a type to the case you have to find all these case statements and change them. The object-oriented notion of polymorphism gives you an elegant way to deal with this problem.</p><p>So most times you see a case statement you should think about polymorphism, the issue is where should the polymorphism occur. Usually case statement will switch on a type code. You will want the method on class that hosts the type code value. So use Extract Method (114) to extract the switch statement and then Move Method (160) to get it onto the class where the polymorphism is needed. At that point you have to decide whether to Replace Type Code with Subclasses (224) or Replace Type Code with State&#x2F;Strategy (227). When you have set up the inheritance structure you can then Replace Switch with Polymorphism (147).</p></blockquote><h3 id="Parallel-Inheritance-Hierarchies"><a href="#Parallel-Inheritance-Hierarchies" class="headerlink" title="Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies"></a>Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies</h3><blockquote><p>This smell is really a special case of “the same rate off change in two objects”. In this case, every time you make a subclass of one class you also have to make a subclass of another. You can recognize this smell because the prefixes of the class names in one hierarchy are the same as the prefixes in another hierarchy.</p><p>The general strategy for eliminating the duplication is to make sure that instances of one hierarchy refer to instances of the other, then use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) the hierarchy disappears on the referring class.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Lazy-Class"><a href="#Lazy-Class" class="headerlink" title="Lazy Class"></a>Lazy Class</h3><blockquote><p>Each class you create costs money. If there is a class that isn’t doing enough to pay for itself, it should be eliminated.</p><p>If you have subclasses that aren’t doing enough, try to use Collapse Hierarchy (288). Nearly useless components should be subjected to Inline Component (170).</p></blockquote><h3 id="Similar-subclasses"><a href="#Similar-subclasses" class="headerlink" title="Similar subclasses"></a>Similar subclasses</h3><blockquote><p>Sometimes you will see a class with four subclasses, each of which only implements three simple methods.

In this case, every time you make a subclass of one class you also have to make a subclass of another. You can recognize this smell because the prefixes of the class names in one hierarchy are the same as the prefixes in another hierarchy.<br>这种气味实际上是“两个物体变化率相同”的特例。在这种情况下，每次创建一个类的子类时，您还必须创建另一个类的子类。您可以识别出这种气味，因为一个层次结构中的类名前缀与另一个层次结构中的前缀相同。</p><p>The general strategy for eliminating the duplication is to make sure that instances of one hierarchy refer to instances of the other, then use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) the hierarchy disappears on the referring class.<br>消除重复的一般策略是确保一个层次结构的实例引用另一层次结构的实例，然后使用移动方法 (160) 和移动字段 (164)，层次结构在引用类上消失。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Lazy-Class懒惰类"><a href="#Lazy-Class懒惰类" class="headerlink" title="Lazy Class懒惰类"></a>Lazy Class懒惰类</h3><blockquote><p>Each class you create costs money. If there is a class that isn’t doing enough to pay for itself, it should be eliminated.<br>您创建的每个类都需要花钱。如果有一个阶级的努力不足以维持其自身的收入，那么它就应该被淘汰。</p><p>If you have subclasses that aren’t doing enough, try to use Collapse Hierarchy (288). Nearly useless components should be subjected to Inline Component (170).<br>如果您的子类做得不够，请尝试使用 Collapse Hierarchy (288)。几乎无用的组件应该受到内联组件（170）的影响。</p><p>Similar subclasses类似的子类<br>Sometimes you will see a class with four subclasses, each of which only implements three simple methods. Often you will get a vague feeling that the class doesn’t deserve subclasses, but you won’t immediately be able to see how to eliminate them. This feeling can last for months or even years. Don’t worry. If you keep nibbling away at the problems you can see how to solve, eventually you will find yourself looking at the subclasses again, and all the difficult issues to resolve will have disappeared.<br>有时你会看到一个类有四个子类，每个子类只实现三个简单的方法。通常你会隐约感觉到该类不值得有子类，但你不会立即知道如何消除它们。这种感觉可以持续数月甚至数年。不用担心。如果你不断地啃那些你能看到如何解决的问题，最终你会发现自己再次查看子类，所有需要解决的难题都将消失。</p><p>Once you’ve done this, look for new opportunities to use inheritance now that you are no longer wasting it.<br>完成此操作后，请寻找新的机会来使用继承，因为您不再浪费它了。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Temporary-Field临时字段"><a href="#Temporary-Field临时字段" class="headerlink" title="Temporary Field临时字段"></a>Temporary Field临时字段</h3><blockquote><p>Sometimes you will see an object where an instance variable is only set in certain circumstances. Such code is difficult to understand, because you expect an object to need all of its variables. Trying to understand why a variable is there when it doesn’t seem to be used can drive you nuts.<br>有时您会看到一个对象，其中的实例变量仅在某些情况下设置。这样的代码很难理解，因为您期望一个对象需要它的所有变量。试图理解一个似乎没有被使用的变量为什么会存在，这会让你发疯。</p><p>Use Extract Component (166) to create a home for the poor orphan variables. Put all the code that concerns the variables in the component.<br>使用提取组件 (166) 为可怜的孤儿变量创建一个家。将所有涉及变量的代码放在组件中。</p><p>You may also be able to eliminate conditional code by using Introduce Null Object (151) to create an alternative component for when the variables aren’t valid.<br>您还可以通过使用引入空对象 (151) 来消除条件代码，以便在变量无效时创建替代组件。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Middle-Man中间人"><a href="#Middle-Man中间人" class="headerlink" title="Middle Man中间人"></a>Middle Man中间人</h3><blockquote><p>One of the prime features of objects is encapsulation: hiding internal details from the rest of the world. Often this encapsulation comes with delegation, you ask a director if she is free a meeting, she delegates the message to her diary, and gives you an answer. All well and good,there is no need to know whether the director uses a diary, an electronic gizmo, or a secretary to keep track of her appointments.<br>对象的主要特征之一是封装：向外界隐藏内部细节。通常这种封装伴随着授权，你问一位主管她是否有空开会，她将信息委托给她的日记，然后给你一个答案。一切都很好，没有必要知道主任是否使用日记、电子小玩意或秘书来记录她的约会。</p><p>However this can go too far (particularly with those who take the Law of Demeter too seriously). You look at a class’s interface and find half the methods are delegating to this other class. After a while it’s time to cut out the middle man and talk to the object that really knows what’s going on. Use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) to move features out of the middle man into the other objects until the middle man has nothing left.<br>然而，这可能太过分了（特别是对于那些过于认真对待德墨忒尔定律的人）。您查看一个类的接口，发现一半的方法委托给了另一个类。过了一会儿，就可以去掉中间人，与真正知道发生了什么的对象进行对话。使用移动方法 (160) 和移动字段 (164) 将特征从中间人移到其他对象中，直到中间人没有任何剩余。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Alternative-classes-with-different-interfaces具有不同接口的替代类"><a href="#Alternative-classes-with-different-interfaces具有不同接口的替代类" class="headerlink" title="Alternative classes with different interfaces具有不同接口的替代类"></a>Alternative classes with different interfaces具有不同接口的替代类</h3><blockquote><p>Use Rename Method (234) on any methods that do the same thing but have different signatures for what they do. Often this doesn’t go far enough. In these cases the classes aren’t doing enough yet. Keep using Move Method (160) to move behavior to them until the protocols are the same. If you have to redundantly move code to accomplish this, you may be able to use Extract Superclass (282) to atone.<br>对执行相同操作但具有不同功能签名的任何方法使用重命名方法 (234)。通常这还不够。在这些情况下，班级做得还不够。继续使用移动方法 (160) 将行为移动到它们，直到协议相同。如果您必须冗余地移动代码来完成此操作，您可以使用 Extract Superclass (282) 来弥补。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Comments注释"><a href="#Comments注释" class="headerlink" title="Comments注释"></a>Comments注释</h3><blockquote><p>Don’t worry, we aren’t saying that people shouldn’t write comments.<br>别担心，我们并不是说人们不应该写注释。</p><p>In our olfactory analogy, comments aren’t a bad smell, indeed they are a sweet smell.<br>在我们的嗅觉比喻中，注释并不是难闻的气味，实际上它们是一种甜蜜的气味。</p><p>The reason we mention them here is because comments are often used as a deodorant. It’s surprising how often you look at thickly commented code, and notice that the comments are there because the code is bad.<br>我们在这里提到它们的原因是因为注释经常被用作除臭剂。令人惊讶的是，当您查看大量注释的代码时，您会发现注释的存在是因为代码很糟糕。</p><p>Thus comments lead us to bad code that has all the rotten whiffs we’ve discussed in the rest of this chapter. Our first action to remove the bad smells by refactoring. When we’re done we often find that the comments are now superfluous.<br>因此，注释会导致我们编写出糟糕的代码，其中包含我们在本章其余部分讨论的所有腐烂的味道。我们的第一个行动是通过重构来消除不良气味。当我们完成后，我们经常发现注释现在是多余的。</p><p>When you feel the need to write a comment, try first to refactor the code so that any comment would be superfluous.<br>当您觉得需要编写注释时，请首先尝试重构代码，以便任何注释都是多余的。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

I’m from England but I’ve been living in the States for five years and the thing I miss the most is Bonfire Night on November 5th.读到每个人最怀念的家乡传统真是太酷了！我来自英国，但我在美国生活了五年，我最怀念的是11月5日的篝火之夜。</p><p>The best thing about Bonfire Night is the fireworks, oh, and the bonfires! … and the history behind it.

I’m from England but I’ve been living in the States for five years and the thing I miss the most is Bonfire Night on November 5th.读到每个人最怀念的家乡传统真是太酷了！我来自英国，但我在美国生活了五年，我最怀念的是11月5日的篝火之夜。</p><p>The best thing about Bonfire Night is the fireworks, oh, and the bonfires! … and the history behind it.

So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you’ve been doing over the past four years or so.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider which offered HR services, including L&amp;D, to corporate clients.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: OK, so it was only B2B?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, that’s right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, I very much like the L&amp;D side of my role and I’ve always had particularly good feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I’m looking to specialise, and as your company has around 2,000 people, right …? </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yes, that’s right.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&amp;D. I’m also a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&amp;D qualification.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we’re looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won’t be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role.  </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yes, that would be a good thing.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Also, I’m used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Um, I think we’ve covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick questions though.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Go on.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Well, there’s the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team, which currently has six people in it. There’s usually an intern or two who you can get some support from also.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: OK. Thanks. That’s all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this role will be measured. What does success look like?</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That’s a good question. As you know, we have a performance management system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs within the organisation. But we haven’t devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and then successfully implement this strategy.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Thank you. That sounds interesting.  </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We’ll be discussing all candidates next week and then I’ll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Thank you for your time. I’d welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>Interviewer: Hello, Maria. Thanks for coming in for the interview.<br>面试官：你好，玛丽亚。感谢您接受面试。</p><p>Maria: It’s my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.<br>玛丽亚：这是我的荣幸。谢谢你邀请我。</p><p>Interviewer: Well, as you know, the company has been expanding and we have an opening in our HR department. We’re creating a new role for someone to lead our training and development within the company.<br>面试官：嗯，如您所知，公司一直在扩张，我们的人力资源部门有一个空缺。我们正在为某人设立一个新角色来领导公司内部的培训和发展。</p><p>Maria: Yes, I very much think that my skills and experience are a good fit for what you’re looking for.<br>玛丽亚：是的，我非常认为我的技能和经验非常适合您正在寻找的东西。</p><p>Interviewer: That sounds great. So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you’ve been doing over the past four years or so.<br>面试官：听起来很棒。所以，你的简历看起来很不错，不过如果你能用你自己的话向我们概述一下你在过去四年左右的时间里所做的事情，那就更好了。</p><p>Maria: Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider which offered HR services, including L&amp;D, to corporate clients.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，四年前，在我的第一份工作中，我为一家小型人力资源服务提供商工作，该提供商为企业客户提供包括学习与发展在内的人力资源服务。</p><p>Interviewer: OK, so it was only B2B?<br>面试官：好的，所以这只是 B2B？</p><p>Maria: Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C.<br>Maria：是的，我们只向其他公司提供服务，而不是 B2C。</p><p>Interviewer: Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago.<br>面试官：是的，上面写着你大约三年前离开了那家公司。</p><p>Maria: Yes, that’s right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development.<br>玛丽亚：是的，没错。我寻求更多的稳定性，并成为更大组织的一部分。因此，我加入了一家拥有大约一百名员工和一个小型人力资源团队的公司。由于我们只有几个人，所以我们每个人都处理一系列人力资源主题。除了工资之外，我负责的领域之一是学习和发展。</p><p>Interviewer: I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now?<br>面试官：我明白了。那么，你为什么现在想换工作呢？</p><p>Maria: Well, I very much like the L&amp;D side of my role and I’ve always had particularly good feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I’m looking to specialise, and as your company has around 2,000 people, right …?<br>玛丽亚：嗯，我非常喜欢我的角色中的学习与发展方面，并且我在该领域的工作一直得到特别好的反馈。我相信我在该领域表现出色。所以，我希望专业化，而贵公司大约有 2,000 名员工，对吧……？</p><p>Interviewer: Yes, that’s right.<br>面试官：是的，没错。</p><p>Maria: Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&amp;D. I’m also a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，这种规模的组织将为我提供专门从事学习与发展的空间。我也是您品牌的忠实追随者，并且感觉与您的形象和价值观完全一致。</p><p>Interviewer: Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&amp;D qualification.<br>面试官：嗯，听起来不错。我可以看到你有 L&amp;D 证书。</p><p>Maria: Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management.<br>玛丽亚：是的，我两年前获得了文凭。我目前还在攻读心理学进一步文凭，特别关注学习和绩效管理。</p><p>Interviewer: Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we’re looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company?<br>面试官：非常好。嗯，看来您具备我们正在寻找的资质和经验。您认为加入一家更大的公司将面临哪些主要挑战？</p><p>Maria: I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won’t be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role.<br>玛丽亚：我可以看到，在如此规模的组织中没有经验可能会被视为一种弱点，而我认为这也可能是一种优势。我不会给这个角色带来太多先入为主、可能不灵活的想法。</p><p>Interviewer: Yes, that would be a good thing.<br>面试官：是的，那将是一件好事。</p><p>Maria: Also, I’m used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale.<br>玛丽亚：此外，我习惯于采取非常个人化的方法来进行员工发展。我意识到，这种拥有 2,000 名员工的方法必须以不同的方式进行，但我带来了许多可以在更大范围内复制的想法。</p><p>Interviewer: I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me?<br>面试官：我明白你的意思。好的，那么，您有什么问题要问我吗？</p><p>Maria: Um, I think we’ve covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick questions though.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，我认为我们已经涵盖了我想要解决的许多领域。不过我有两个简单的问题。</p><p>Interviewer: Go on.<br>面试官：继续。</p><p>Maria: Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?<br>玛丽亚：我每天主要和谁一起工作？</p><p>Interviewer: Well, there’s the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team, which currently has six people in it. There’s usually an intern or two who you can get some support from also.<br>面试官：嗯，您要向人力资源经理汇报。然后是人力资源团队，目前有六人。通常还有一两个实习生，你也可以从他们那里得到一些支持。</p><p>Maria: OK. Thanks. That’s all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this role will be measured. What does success look like?<br>玛丽亚：好的。谢谢。这一切都很清楚。我的另一个问题是如何衡量这个角色的表现。成功是什么样的？</p><p>Interviewer: That’s a good question. As you know, we have a performance management system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs within the organisation. But we haven’t devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and then successfully implement this strategy.<br>面试官：这是个好问题。如您所知，我们有一个绩效管理系统，从中我们确定了组织内的一些学习和发展需求。但我们还没有制定策略。您的角色是制定并成功实施该策略。</p><p>Maria: Thank you. That sounds interesting.<br>玛丽亚：谢谢。听起来很有趣。</p><p>Interviewer: Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We’ll be discussing all candidates next week and then I’ll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome.<br>面试官：太好了。再次感谢您今天的光临。我们将在下周讨论所有候选人，然后我会在下周末之前回复您，让您知道结果。</p><p>Maria: Thank you for your time. I’d welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.<br>玛丽亚：谢谢您的宝贵时间。我很高兴有机会与您继续讨论这个角色。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-job-interview-–-1"><a href="#A-job-interview-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A job interview – 1"></a>A job interview – 1</h4><p>Choose the correct answers.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>Four years ago, Maria worked for a small HR services provider …<br>a. in the B2B sector.<br>b. in the B2C sector.<br>c. in both B2B and B2C sectors.</li><li>Maria has been in her current job …<br>a. for four years.<br>b. for three years.<br>c. for one year.</li><li>Maria’s current role is focused …<br>a. only on learning and development.<br>b. on a number of HR topics.<br>c. only on payroll and she wants to do L&amp;D.</li><li>Maria …<br>a. did a diploma in L&amp;D two years ago.<br>b. is doing a diploma in psychology at the moment.<br>c.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question. Or, for example, ‘And which office is that again?’ Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I get you …</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>Presenter: So, today’s expert teacher is Gabriella, a university English teacher from Leeds. Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.<br>主持人：今天的专家老师是来自利兹的大学英语老师 Gabriella。加布里埃拉，您好，感谢您今天加入我们。</p><p>Gabriella: Thanks for having me!<br>加布里埃拉：谢谢你邀请我！</p><p>Presenter: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account.

Or, for example, ‘And which office is that again?’ Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question.

Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account.

That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question.

Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter.

That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question.

Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter.

That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question.

Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account.

That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question.

Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter.

That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question.

Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account.

That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question.

Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter.

We’ve got a really diverse team here – people of different nationalities, backgrounds, religions, ages … and sometimes I don’t feel we make the most of this.尼娜：嗯，我们都知道团队的多样性是一件好事，但对于某些人来说，尊重和重视人们的差异也可能是一个挑战。我们这里有一支非常多元化的团队——来自不同国籍、背景、宗教、年龄的人……有时我觉得我们没有充分利用这一点。</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: Yes, and even if it isn’t specifically challenging, many people are simply unaware of the isolation that some team members may feel because they are different.

Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things.布伦达：是的，我喜欢这样。许多人将多样性视为负面事物，通常是因为存在不同的观点或做事方式。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Yes, I know, but if there’s no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate.尼娜：是的，我知道，但如果没有多样性，那么风险就是我们所有人都以同样的方式工作，思考同样的问题，看待世界也一样。这使得创造力和创新变得困难。</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: I completely agree, Nina. OK.

I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn’t it? It says here it’s about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it’s about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Yes, but in space that’s not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That’s why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn’t sound so big when you look at it that way.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you’re right. What other similarities are there between the two planets?</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Let’s see … not the colour, obviously!</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons!</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth’s day is 24 hours but Mars’s is about half an hour longer.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: You’re right. OK, any other things they both share?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I suppose you could say they have water in common.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Could you? How?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It’s just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Ah, I see. I don’t think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth’s air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Mars doesn’t really have air, not compared with Earth. It’s got about one per cent as much air as Earth.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Right, and it’s mostly carbon dioxide.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Gravity is another difference. I didn’t know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it’s much less than on Earth, of course.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth’s gravity.</p><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: OK, let’s see what you’ve found …</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: So you’ve got a few minutes to discuss with your partner.老师：那么你有几分钟时间与你的搭档讨论。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: So, as far as I know, the main similarity between Mars and Earth is that they can both support human life.学生 1：据我所知，火星和地球的主要相似之处在于它们都可以支持人类生命。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah, but do we know that’s actually true? I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn’t it? It says here it’s about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold.学生 2：是的，但我们知道这是真的吗？我的意思是，火星比地球冷得多，不是吗？据说这里大部分时间的气温约为负55度，而在地球上只有像南极洲这样的地方才会这么冷。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun?学生 1：是的。那么，我想你可以说两颗行星到太阳的距离相似？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it’s about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.学生 2：不可能！火星还远着呢！它说这里大约有2.28亿公里，而地球大约有1.5亿公里。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Yes, but in space that’s not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That’s why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn’t sound so big when you look at it that way.学生 1：是的，但在太空中并没有那么远。木星大约有 7.8 亿公里。这就是为什么我们在谈论太空距离时使用天文单位。地球距太阳 1 个天文单位，火星距太阳 1.3 个天文单位。当你这样看时，差异听起来并没有那么大。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you’re right. What other similarities are there between the two planets?学生 2：我明白你的意思。木星是 5.2 个天文单位，所以我想你是对的。这两颗行星之间还有哪些相似之处？</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Let’s see … not the colour, obviously!学生 1：让我们看看……显然不是颜色！</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons!学生 2：是啊！地球被称为蓝色星球，火星被称为红色星球，原因非常明显！</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.学生 1：它们的尺寸差别很大。火星的大小约为地球的一半。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth’s day is 24 hours but Mars’s is about half an hour longer.学生 2：这个怎么样？看起来两个行星上的白天几乎一样长。地球的一天是24小时，但火星的一天大约长半小时。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: You’re right. OK, any other things they both share?学生 1：你说得对。好吧，他们还有其他共同点吗？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I suppose you could say they have water in common.学生 2：我想你可以说它们有水的共同点。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Could you? How?学生 1：你可以吗？如何？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It’s just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.学生 2：嗯，地球 70% 是水，火星过去可能有巨大的海洋。只是现在那里的水估计大部分都结冰了。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Ah, I see. I don’t think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth’s air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?学生 1：啊，我明白了。但我认为我们不能说空气是一样的。地球上的空气大部分是氮气和氧气，但火星……？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Mars doesn’t really have air, not compared with Earth. It’s got about one per cent as much air as Earth.学生 2：与地球相比，火星实际上并没有空气。它的空气含量大约是地球的百分之一。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Right, and it’s mostly carbon dioxide.学生 1：是的，主要是二氧化碳。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Gravity is another difference. I didn’t know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it’s much less than on Earth, of course.学生 2：重力是另一个区别。我不知道，但火星的引力比月球大。但当然，它比地球上要少得多。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth’s gravity.学生 1：哦，是的。据称，火星的重力约为地球的 38%。</p><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: OK, let’s see what you’ve found …老师：好吧，让我们看看你发现了什么……</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task-1"><a href="#Task-1" class="headerlink" title="Task 1"></a>Task 1</h3><h4 id="A-student-discussion-–-1"><a href="#A-student-discussion-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A student discussion – 1"></a>A student discussion – 1</h4><p>Put the characteristics in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>Has more nitrogen<br>Is 50 per cent smaller<br>Is closer to the Sun<br>Has more air<br>Has stronger gravity<br>Used to have water  and oxygen than carbon dioxide<br>Has a longer day<br>Is colder</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Earth                         Mars</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/03/22/b1-listening-02-student-discussion/image-20240411094854178.png" class="" title="image-20240411094854178"><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p>a</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>b</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/03/22/b1-listening-02-student-discussion/image-20240411095335284.png" class="" title="image-20240411095335284"><h4 id="Task-2"><a href="#Task-2" class="headerlink" title="Task 2"></a>Task 2</h4><ul><li><p>Question</p><blockquote><p>frozensameGravitynitrogensupportastronomical</p><ol><li>Most people think Mars can [] human life.</li><li>We measure distances in space using [] units.</li><li>The two planets aren’t the [] color.</li><li>Most of the water on Mars is probably [].</li><li>The air on Earth is mostly made up of [].</li><li>[] on Mars is just over one third as strong as on Earth.</li></ol></blockquote></li><li><p>Answer</p></li></ul><h4 id="Discussion-讨论"><a href="#Discussion-讨论" class="headerlink" title="Discussion 讨论"></a>Discussion 讨论</h4><blockquote><p>Do you think people will live on Mars one day?你认为有一天人们会在火星上生活吗？</p></blockquote>]]></content>

What do you need?<br>Junko：帮个忙？你需要什么？</p><p>Andrea: This is a little, er … difficult, but I need an extension on the payment terms.

You’d really be helping us out if you could extend it to 60 days.<br>安德里亚：这有点，呃……困难，但我需要延长付款条件。我知道通常是 30 天，但我们遇到了一些现金流问题。如果您能将期限延长至 60 天，那您真是帮了我们大忙了。</p><p>Junko: I’m not sure if I can do that, Andrea.

So your cash flow problem will be solved after this new order is delivered.<br>Junko：我明白了。所以这个新订单交付后，你的现金流问题就解决了。</p><p>Andrea: Exactly.<br>安德里亚：没错。</p><p>Junko: That sounds good. Hold on, Andrea.

OK, it’s the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don’t get it.</p><p><strong>Professor</strong>: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: I’m not sure.</p><p><strong>Professor</strong>: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.</p><p><strong>Professor</strong>: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: Could you give us some more examples?</p><p><strong>Professor</strong>: OK … well, we don’t have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>Professor: OK, before we continue, does anybody have a question? Oh, lots of questions, I see. OK, we’ll go one at a time. Yes?<br>教授：好的，在我们继续之前，有人有问题吗？哦，我看看，有很多问题。好的，我们一次回答一个。是的？</p><p>Student: Thank you. You talked about Fibonacci numbers in the lecture. Sorry, I don’t understand. Can you explain?<br>学生：谢谢。您在讲座中谈到了斐波那契数列。抱歉，我不明白。你可以解释吗？</p><p>Professor: Of course. What do you want to know?<br>教授：当然。你想知道什么？</p><p>Student: OK … I hope this isn’t a silly question, but what does Fibonacci actually mean?<br>学生：好的……我希望这不是一个愚蠢的问题，但是斐波那契实际上意味着什么？</p><p>Professor: No question is ever silly – it’s always good to ask. OK, it’s the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.<br>教授：没有任何问题是愚蠢的——提出总是好的。好吧，这是一个人的名字。斐波那契是中世纪欧洲数学家。</p><p>Student: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don’t get it.<br>学生：啊，好的。谢谢。所以，我们知道他是一个人，但是斐波那契数是多少？我不明白。</p><p>Professor: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?<br>教授：斐波那契数列是一个数字序列。他们走1、1、2、3、5、8等等。你看到顺序了吗？你明白它是如何运作的吗？</p><p>Student: I’m not sure.<br>学生：我不确定。</p><p>Professor: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.<br>教授：好的。这就是它的工作原理。第一个数字是 1，然后又是 1，最后是 2。第三个数字是第一个数字加上第二个数字。第四个数字是第二个数字加上第三个数字：1 加 2 等于 3。第五个数字是第三个数字 2 加上第四个数字 3。因此斐波那契数列中的第五个数字是 5。</p><p>Student: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.<br>学生：啊！我想我现在明白了。但它们的重要性又如何呢？你说这些非常重要。</p><p>Professor: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere.<br>教授：是的，让我解释一下。这个数字序列很重要，因为我们在很多事情中都能看到它。斐波那契数在几何学中很常见，在自然界中也很常见，例如在植物中。我们随处可见这种顺序。</p><p>Student: Could you give us some more examples?<br>学生：您能给我们举一些更多的例子吗？</p><p>Professor: OK … well, we don’t have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?<br>教授：好吧……好吧，我们现在没有时间，但我可以在下节课上举更多例子，好吗？</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="Understanding-an-explanation-–-1"><a href="#Understanding-an-explanation-–-1" class="headerlink" title="Understanding an explanation – 1"></a>Understanding an explanation – 1</h4><p>Choose the correct answer.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The professor says there …<br>are lots of questions.<br>is only one question.<br>are no questions.</li><li>Fibonacci was …<br>from central England.<br>the first in a sequence of scientists.<br>a mathematician.</li><li>What is the next number in this Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, …<br>6<br>7<br>8</li><li>What does the professor say about Fibonacci numbers?<br>They are common.<br>They are uncommon.<br>They are very difficult to understand.</li><li>What does the professor promise?<br>To explain better<br>To bring examples to next class<br>To include this in the exam</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The professor says there …<br>✔are lots of questions.<br>is only one question.<br>are no questions.</li><li>Fibonacci was …<br>from central England.<br>the first in a sequence of scientists.<br>✔a mathematician.</li><li>What is the next number in this Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, …<br>6<br>7<br>✔8</li><li>What does the professor say about Fibonacci numbers?<br>✔They are common.<br>They are uncommon.<br>They are very difficult to understand.</li><li>What does the professor promise?<br>To explain better<br>✔To bring examples to next class<br>To include this in the exam</li></ol></blockquote><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="Understanding-an-explanation-–-2"><a href="#Understanding-an-explanation-–-2" class="headerlink" title="Understanding an explanation – 2"></a>Understanding an explanation – 2</h4><p>Put the words in order.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>not about the sequence. sure I’m </li><li>understand.

It takes around 8 to 10 hours to cross the canal.巴拿马运河是中美洲国家巴拿马的一条人工水道，连接大西洋和太平洋。全长仅82公里。如果乘船环游南美洲，则还需要行驶 15,000 公里。所以运河节省了大量的旅行时间。穿越运河大约需要8到10个小时。</p><p>The French started building the canal in 1881, but they couldn’t finish it. The project was started again in 1904 by the United States and the canal was finally finished in 1914. Many people died while they were building the canal, some say up to 25,000. For the rest of the 20th century, the United States controlled the canal, but gave control back to Panama in 2000.法国人于1881年开始修建运河，但未能完工。 1904年，美国再次启动这项工程，运河终于在1914年竣工。在修建运河的过程中，有很多人死亡，有人说多达25000人。在 20 世纪余下的时间里，美国控制着这条运河，但在 2000 年将控制权交还给了巴拿马。</p><p>Every year, around 40,000 ships come through the canal. These are mostly commercial ships. They transport goods for trade between Asia and America, or Europe. In 2016 the government of Panama made the canal bigger, so that now 99 per cent of ships can pass through it.每年约有 40,000 艘船只通过运河。这些大多是商船。他们运输亚洲和美洲或欧洲之间的贸易货物。 2016 年，巴拿马政府扩建了运河，现在 99% 的船只可以通过。</p><p>Let’s now turn to the role of the Panama Canal in the global economy …现在让我们谈谈巴拿马运河在全球经济中的作用……</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="Facts-and-figures-–-1"><a href="#Facts-and-figures-–-1" class="headerlink" title="Facts and figures – 1"></a>Facts and figures – 1</h4><p>Put the topics in order.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084104286.png" class="" title="image-20240401084104286"><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084217530.png" class="" title="image-20240401084217530"><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="Facts-and-figures-–-2"><a href="#Facts-and-figures-–-2" class="headerlink" title="Facts and figures – 2"></a>Facts and figures – 2</h4><p>Complete the sentences with the correct numbers.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084811948.png" class="" title="image-20240401084811948"><blockquote><ol><li>The Panama Canal connects ____ oceans. </li><li>It is ____ kilometres long. </li><li>It is ____ kilometres to travel around South America. </li><li>It takes ____ hours to cross the canal. </li><li>The canal was started in ____ . </li><li>It was finished in ____ . </li><li>Almost ____ people died while they were building the canal. </li><li>The control of the canal returned to Panama in ____ . </li><li>Every year, about ____ ships come through the canal. </li><li>Now the canal is bigger, and ____ per cent of ships can pass through it.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401085125668.png" class="" title="image-20240401085125668">]]></content>

In the meantime, we’ll continue with our projects as usual.<br>大家好。我知道你们都很忙，所以我会尽快做这个简报。我有一些关于管理团队变动的重要信息。如您所知，我们的部门主管詹姆斯·沃森将于本周末离职。他的继任者将从下个月底开始。与此同时，我们将像往常一样继续我们的项目。</p><p>I have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time.<br>我还有两点要点。首先，下个月将在几周内对员工停车场进行一些改进。在此期间它将关闭。</p><p>Don’t worry, we’ve found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It’s only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I know how much you all love working late!<br>别担心，我们已经找到解决方案了。我们可以使用当地教堂的停车场，直到我们自己的停车场准备好为止。如果您在上午 8.30 点之前抵达，请使用我们位于布朗街的小型停车场，如果您在此之后抵达，请直接前往教堂停车场。步行只需五分钟。但他们晚上需要，所以你必须在下午 6 点之前离开。抱歉——我知道你们有多喜欢工作到很晚！</p><p>The other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can’t use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card.

That’s it?

She was excited about her new role but soon realised that managing her new team would be a challenge.<br>加布里埃拉曾在巴西的一家跨国公司担任成功的项目经理，后来调到瑞典管理一个团队。她对自己的新角色感到兴奋，但很快意识到管理新团队将是一项挑战。</p><p>Despite their friendliness, Gabriela didn’t feel respected as a leader. Her new staff would question her proposals openly in meetings, and when she gave them instructions on how to carry out a task, they would often go about it in their own way without checking with her. When she announced her decisions on the project, they would continue giving their opinions as if it was still up for discussion.<br>尽管他们很友善，但加布里埃拉并没有感到作为领导者受到尊重。她的新员工会在会议上公开质疑她的建议，当她向他们指示如何执行任务时，他们往往会以自己的方式进行，而不与她协商。当她宣布对这个项目的决定时，他们会继续发表自己的意见，就好像这个项目仍在讨论中一样。</p><p>After weeks of frustration, Gabriela emailed her Swedish manager about the issues she was facing with her team. Her manager simply asked her if she felt her team was still performing, and what she thought would help her better collaborate with her team members. Gabriela found her manager vague and didn’t feel as if he was managing the situation satisfactorily.<br>经过几周的沮丧之后，加布里埃拉向她的瑞典经理发送了电子邮件，讲述了她与团队面临的问题。她的经理只是问她是否觉得她的团队仍在表现，以及她认为什么可以帮助她更好地与团队成员合作。加布里埃拉发现她的经理含糊其辞，感觉他对局势的处理并不令人满意。</p><p>What Gabriela was experiencing was a cultural clash in expectations. She was used to a more hierarchical framework where the team leader and manager took control and gave specific instructions on how things were to be done.

When Gabriela took the issue to her Swedish manager, rather than stepping in with directions about what to do, her manager took on the role of coach and focused on getting her to come up with her own solutions instead.<br>加布里埃拉所经历的是期望中的文化冲突。她习惯了一个更加层级化的框架，在这个框架中，团队领导者和经理负责控制，并就如何完成工作给出具体指示。这种更具指导性的管理风格对她和她在巴西的团队来说效果很好，但并没有很好地转移到她在瑞典的新团队，他们更习惯于决策更加民主的扁平化等级制度。当加布里埃拉向她的瑞典经理提出这个问题时，她的经理没有介入指导该怎么做，而是扮演了教练的角色，专注于让她提出自己的解决方案。</p><p>Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede uses the concept of ‘power distance’ to describe how power is distributed and how hierarchy is perceived in different cultures. In her previous work environment, Gabriela was used to a high power distance culture where power and authority are respected and everyone has their rightful place.

Her Swedish team, however, were used to working in a low power distance culture where subordinates often work together with their bosses to find solutions and make decisions. Here, leaders act as coaches or mentors who encourage independent thought and expect to be challenged.<br>荷兰社会心理学家吉尔特·霍夫斯泰德（Geert Hofstede）使用“权力距离”的概念来描述不同文化中权力的分配方式以及等级制度的感知方式。在之前的工作环境中，加布里埃拉习惯了高权力距离文化，在这种文化中，权力和权威受到尊重，每个人都有自己应有的地位。在这种文化中，领导者会做出重大决策，并且不会经常受到挑战。然而，她的瑞典团队习惯于在低权力距离文化中工作，下属经常与老板一起寻找解决方案并做出决策。在这里，领导者充当教练或导师，鼓励独立思考并期待受到挑战。</p><p>When Gabriela became aware of the cultural differences between her and her team, she took the initiative to have an open conversation with them about their feelings about her leadership. Pleased to be asked for their thoughts, Gabriela’s team openly expressed that they were not used to being told what to do. They enjoyed having more room for initiative and creative freedom.

They realised that Gabriela was taking it personally when they tried to challenge or make changes to her decisions, and were able to explain that it was how they’d always worked.<br>当加布里埃拉意识到她和她的团队之间的文化差异时，她主动与他们进行公开对话，了解他们对她的领导力的感受。加布里埃拉的团队很高兴被问及他们的想法，并公开表示他们不习惯被告知该做什么。他们喜欢有更多的主动性和创造性自由的空间。当她准确地告诉团队她需要他们做什么时，他们觉得她不相信他们能做好工作。他们意识到，当他们试图挑战或改变加布里埃拉的决定时，她是在针对她个人的想法，并能够解释说，这就是他们一直以来的工作方式。</p><p>With a better understanding of the underlying reasons behind each other’s behaviour, Gabriela and her team were able to adapt their way of working. Gabriela was then able to make adjustments to her management style so as to better fit the expectations of her team and more effectively motivate her team to achieve their goals.<br>通过更好地了解彼此行为背后的根本原因，加布里埃拉和她的团队能够调整他们的工作方式。加布里埃拉随后能够调整自己的管理风格，以更好地满足团队的期望，并更有效地激励团队实现目标。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task-1任务1"><a href="#Task-1任务1" class="headerlink" title="Task 1任务1"></a>Task

Innovation is key to increasing profits.为了让企业在当今世界生存，定期审查我们正在做什么以及如何做非常重要。通过考虑新的想法和新的做事方式并尝试创新，我们可以改进我们的产品&#x2F;服务、增加销量、降低成本并使我们的流程更加有效和高效。创新是增加利润的关键。</p><p>There are several ways a company can be innovative with their products and services. Today we will look at four of them.公司可以通过多种方式对其产品和服务进行创新。今天我们将看看其中的四个。</p><p><strong>1. Using the latest technology to improve your product&#x2F;service</strong><br><strong>1. 使用最新技术来改进您的产品&#x2F;服务</strong></p><p>When we think of innovation, we often think of new technologies. While they might be impressive, we should not use new technologies just because they are available. It is important to consider how the technology can improve our product&#x2F;service and make a difference to our customer. Companies that produce cars, toiletries, household appliances, etc. often have a large R&amp;D department to work on making their products better.<br>当我们想到创新时，我们经常想到新技术。虽然它们可能令人印象深刻，但我们不应该仅仅因为新技术可用就使用它们。重要的是要考虑技术如何改进我们的产品&#x2F;服务并为我们的客户带来改变。生产汽车、盥洗用品、家用电器等的公司通常拥有庞大的研发部门来致力于改进他们的产品。</p><p><strong>2. Responding to customer demands by changing what is on offer</strong><br><strong>2. 通过改变所提供的产品来响应客户需求</strong></p><p>By listening to customer feedback, we can get their opinions on how we are doing and find out about what it is that they want. We also need to be aware of changes in customer demands and keep up with the times. When fast-food restaurant McDonald’s realised that the market wanted healthier choices, they introduced fruit and salads, while removing the ‘super-size’ option from their menus.<br>通过倾听客户的反馈，我们可以了解他们对我们的做法的意见，并了解他们想要什么。我们还需要了解客户需求的变化，与时俱进。当麦当劳快餐店意识到市场需要更健康的选择时，他们推出了水果和沙拉，同时从菜单中删除了“超大份”选项。</p><p><strong>3. Offering a new product&#x2F;service to reach new customers</strong><br><strong>3. 提供新产品&#x2F;服务来吸引新客户</strong></p><p>Your business might be doing well, but there is no growth or development and there is a risk that your competitors might take away some of your customers. Innovation sometimes means developing a new product that targets a different market. Although video games were often played by boys, in 2006, video games giant Nintendo introduced the game console Nintendo Wii, successfully targeting girls and older customers with games like Cooking Mama and Brain Training.<br>您的业务可能表现良好，但没有增长或发展，并且存在竞争对手可能抢走您的部分客户的风险。创新有时意味着开发针对不同市场的新产品。尽管视频游戏通常由男孩玩，但视频游戏巨头任天堂在 2006 年推出了游戏机 Nintendo Wii，通过《烹饪妈妈》和《大脑训练》等游戏成功瞄准了女孩和老年客户。</p><p><strong>4. Changing the way you provide a service</strong><br><strong>4. 改变提供服务的方式</strong></p><p>By looking at the changes to the customer’s lifestyle and needs, we sometimes realise that there might be better ways to serve them. Customers who do not have a lot of time might prefer to have their food or their shopping delivered to their homes, or they might like to do their banking online rather than in an actual bank.<br>通过观察客户生活方式和需求的变化，我们有时会意识到可能有更好的方式来服务他们。没有太多时间的客户可能更喜欢将食物或购物品送到家中，或者他们可能喜欢在网上而不是在实际的银行办理银行业务。</p><p>Not all innovation will bring success to our businesses, but it can give us the opportunity to grow and learn more about what we do and what our customers might want.<br>并非所有创新都会给我们的业务带来成功，但它可以让我们有机会成长并更多地了解我们的工作和客户可能想要什么。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task-1-任务1"><a href="#Task-1-任务1" class="headerlink" title="Task 1-任务1"></a>Task 1-任务1</h3><h4 id="Innovation-in-business-–-1"><a href="#Innovation-in-business-–-1" class="headerlink" title="Innovation in business – 1"></a>Innovation in business – 1</h4><p>Fill the gaps with the correct word.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>aware         recent        innovative       customers convenient      development        better         demands</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We need to introduce (1) ideas and ways of doing things so that we can improve and grow.

Children under 17 in the UK are leaving the site – only 2.2 million users are under 17 – but they’re not going far from their smartphones.

That’s how we did it when I was a child, but I think I’m lucky I get to see so much more of their lives than my grandparents did.’<br>59 岁的希拉说：“我加入是为了看看我的孙子们在做什么，我的女儿则发布了他们的视频和照片。与等待邮件中的信件和照片相比，这是了解他们在做什么的更好方法。当我还是个孩子的时候，我们就是这么做的，但我想我很幸运，我比我的祖父母看到了更多的他们的生活。</p><p>Ironically, Sheila’s grandchildren are less likely to use Facebook themselves.

Chloe, aged 15, even sleeps with her phone. ‘It’s my alarm clock so I have to,’ she says. ‘I look at it before I go to sleep and as soon as I wake up.’<br>讽刺的是，希拉的孙子们自己使用 Facebook 的可能性较小。英国 17 岁以下的儿童正在离开该网站（只有 220 万用户未满 17 岁），但他们并没有远离智能手机。 15 岁的 Chloe 甚至睡觉时都带着手机。 “这是我的闹钟，所以我必须这样做，”她说。 “我在睡觉前和醒来后都会看它。”</p><p>Unlike her grandmother’s generation, Chloe’s age group is spending so much time on their phones at home that they are missing out on spending time with their friends in real life. Sheila, on the other hand, has made contact with old friends from school she hasn’t heard from in forty years. ‘We use Facebook to arrange to meet all over the country,’ she says. ‘It’s changed my social life completely.’<br>与她祖母那一代人不同，克洛伊这个年龄段的人在家里花太多时间在手机上，以至于错过了在现实生活中与朋友共度时光的机会。另一方面，希拉与四十年来没有音讯的学校老朋友取得了联系。 “我们使用 Facebook 安排全国各地的见面会，”她说。 “它彻底改变了我的社交生活。”</p><p>Teenagers might have their parents to thank for their smartphone and social media addiction as their parents were the early adopters of the smartphone.

can only make calls and send text messages. ‘I’m not completely cut off from the world in case of emergencies, but the important thing is I’m setting a better example to my kids and spending more quality time with them.’<br>青少年对智能手机和社交媒体的沉迷可能要感谢他们的父母，因为他们的父母是智能手机的早期采用者。 38 岁的彼得是两个青少年的父亲，他说他过去经常使用手机或笔记本电脑。 “我始终保持在线状态，感觉自己一直在工作，”他说。 “如果我自己总是站在屏幕前，我怎么能告诉我的孩子们放下手机呢？”于是，晚上和周末，他就把SIM卡从智能手机上拿出来，装进只能打电话和发短信的老式手机里。 “在紧急情况下，我并没有完全与世界隔绝，但重要的是我为我的孩子们树立了更好的榜样，并与他们共度了更多美好时光。”</p><p>Is it only a matter of time until the generation above and

Good memories.这是你和我在悉尼餐厅的照片。那是一个非常有趣的夜晚！还记得那个唱歌的英国人吗？疯狂的！请把那天晚上的其他照片发给我。好的记忆。</p><p>Please give me your email address and I will send you the documents.请给我您的电子邮件地址，我会将文件发送给您。</p><p>Bye for now暂时再见</p><p>Mikel米克尔</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task-1任务1"><a href="#Task-1任务1" class="headerlink" title="Task 1任务1"></a>Task 1任务1</h3><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>Match the sentences (a–d) with the places (1–4).<br>Places<br>1.Berlin<br>2.London<br>3.Mexico City<br>4.Sydney</p><p>Sentences<br>a.
