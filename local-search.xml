Instead, you’ll be taking part in a phone interview, the results of which will determine whether you’re invited to meet with company representatives in person.</p><p>Many companies use phone interviews as an initial employment screening technique for a variety of reasons. Because they’re generally brief, phone interviews save companies time. They also serve as a more realistic screening alternative for cases in which companies are considering out-of-town (or out-of-province and foreign) candidates.</p><p>So the chances are pretty good that, at some point in your job hunt, you’ll be asked to participate in a 20- to 30-minute phone interview with either one person or several people on the other end of the line. In many ways, the way you prepare for a phone interview isn’t all that different from the way you’d get ready for a face-to-face interview – save for a few slight additions to and modifications of your list of preparation tasks.</p><p>Here’s what to do:</p><p><strong>1. Treat the phone interview seriously, just as you would a face-to-face interview.</strong></p><p>A phone interview seems so informal on the surface that it can be easy to fall into the trap of “phoning it in” – i.e., not preparing for it as well as you would for an in-person interview. Don’t get caught with your guard down. Be sure to research the company, study the job description, and practice your responses to anticipated questions, just as you would for any other interview.</p><p><strong>2. Have your resume and cover letter in front of you.</strong></p><p>You’ll almost certainly be asked about some of the information that appears on these documents. You might also want to have in front of you any supporting materials that relate to information in your resume and cover letter, like documents you’ve designed or written, a portfolio of your various projects, or the written position description from your past positions.</p><p><strong>3. Make a cheat sheet.</strong></p><p>Jot down a few notes about the most critical points you want to make with your interviewer(s). Are there certain skills and experiences you want to emphasize? Do you have certain interests or passions you want your interviewer(s) to know about and understand? Be sure these pieces of information appear on your crib sheet. Then touch on them during the interview, even if your only chance to do so is at the end of the session when the interviewer asks you if you have any questions or anything to add.</p><p><strong>4. Get a high-quality phone.</strong></p><p>This isn’t the time to use a cell phone that cuts in and out, or a cheaply made phone that makes it difficult for you and your interviewer(s) to hear and understand each other.</p><p><strong>5. Shower, groom and dress up (at least a little).</strong></p><p>Odd advice? Perhaps. But focusing on your appearance, just as you would for a normal interview, will put you in the right frame of mind from a psychological standpoint. You won’t do as well in your phone interview if you’re lying in bed, for example, or if you’re draped over your couch in your pajamas.</p><p><strong>6. Stand up, or at least sit up straight at a table or desk.</strong></p><p>Again, there’s a psychological, frame of mind aspect to consider here. But on a more tangible level, research has shown that you project yourself better when you’re standing up, and you’ll feel more knowledgeable and confident.</p><p>Phone interviews can be tricky, especially since you aren’t able to read your interviewers’ nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language during the session – a big difference from the typical interview. But if you prepare well for your phone interview, you won’t need to read anyone’s nonverbals to gauge your performance. You’ll know for sure how you’ve done because you’ll be invited to <a href="https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/different-types-of-interviews-canada">a face-to-face interview</a>, where you’ll have yet another opportunity to prove you’re the best person for the job.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You just got word that you landed a job interview with a company that really interests you – only there’s a slight catch.<br>你刚刚收到消息说你得到了一家你真正感兴趣的公司的面试机会——只是有一个小问题。</p><p>You won’t be meeting with your interviewer(s) face to face. Instead, you’ll be taking part in a phone interview, the results of which will determine whether you’re invited to meet with company representatives in person.<br>您不会与面试官面对面会面。相反，您将参加电话面试，面试结果将决定您是否被邀请与公司代表亲自会面。</p><p>Many companies use phone interviews as an initial employment screening technique for a variety of reasons. Because they’re generally brief, phone interviews save companies time. They also serve as a more realistic screening alternative for cases in which companies are considering out-of-town (or out-of-province and foreign) candidates.<br>出于多种原因，许多公司使用电话面试作为初次就业筛选技术。由于电话面试通常很简短，因此可以节省公司的时间。对于公司正在考虑外地（或省外和外国）候选人的情况，它们还可以作为更现实的筛选替代方案。</p><p>So the chances are pretty good that, at some point in your job hunt, you’ll be asked to participate in a 20- to 30-minute phone interview with either one person or several people on the other end of the line. In many ways, the way you prepare for a phone interview isn’t all that different from the way you’d get ready for a face-to-face interview – save for a few slight additions to and modifications of your list of preparation tasks.<br>因此，很有可能，在您找工作的某个时刻，您会被要求参加一个 20 到 30 分钟的电话面试，面试对象可能是电话另一端的一个人，也可能是几个人。在很多方面，准备电话面试的方式与准备面对面面试的方式并没有什么不同——除了对准备清单进行一些细微的补充和修改之外任务。</p><p>Here’s what to do:<br>该怎么做：</p><p><strong>1. Treat the phone interview seriously, just as you would a face-to-face interview.</strong><br><strong>1. 认真对待电话面试，就像对待面对面面试一样。</strong></p><p>A phone interview seems so informal on the surface that it can be easy to fall into the trap of “phoning it in” – i.e., not preparing for it as well as you would for an in-person interview. Don’t get caught with your guard down. Be sure to research the company, study the job description, and practice your responses to anticipated questions, just as you would for any other interview.<br>电话面试表面上看起来非常非正式，很容易陷入“打电话面试”的陷阱——也就是说，没有像面对面面试那样做好准备。不要放松警惕。一定要研究公司，研究职位描述，并练习对预期问题的回答，就像任何其他面试一样。</p><p><strong>2. Have your resume and cover letter in front of you.</strong><br><strong>2. 将您的简历和求职信放在您的面前。</strong></p><p>You’ll almost certainly be asked about some of the information that appears on these documents. You might also want to have in front of you any supporting materials that relate to information in your resume and cover letter, like documents you’ve designed or written, a portfolio of your various projects, or the written position description from your past positions.<br>几乎肯定会询问您这些文档中出现的一些信息。您可能还需要准备与简历和求职信中的信息相关的任何支持材料，例如您设计或编写的文件、各种项目的组合或您过去职位的书面职位描述。</p><p><strong>3. Make a cheat sheet.</strong><br><strong>3. 制作备忘单。</strong></p><p>Jot down a few notes about the most critical points you want to make with your interviewer(s). Are there certain skills and experiences you want to emphasize? Do you have certain interests or passions you want your interviewer(s) to know about and understand? Be sure these pieces of information appear on your crib sheet. Then touch on them during the interview, even if your only chance to do so is at the end of the session when the interviewer asks you if you have any questions or anything to add.<br>记下一些关于您想向面试官提出的最关键观点的笔记。您想强调某些技能和经验吗？您是否有某些兴趣或热情希望面试官了解和理解？确保这些信息出现在您的备忘单上。然后在面试过程中触及它们，即使你唯一的机会是在面试结束时面试官问你是否有任何问题或有什么要补充的时候。</p><p><strong>4. Get a high-quality phone.</strong><br><strong>4. 买一部高质量的手机。</strong></p><p>This isn’t the time to use a cell phone that cuts in and out, or a cheaply made phone that makes it difficult for you and your interviewer(s) to hear and understand each other.<br>现在不是使用断断续续的手机或廉价手机的时候，因为这会让你和面试官很难听到和理解对方的声音。</p><p><strong>5. Shower, groom and dress up (at least a little).</strong><br><strong>5. 淋浴、打扮和打扮（至少一点点）。</strong></p><p>Odd advice? Perhaps. But focusing on your appearance, just as you would for a normal interview, will put you in the right frame of mind from a psychological standpoint. You won’t do as well in your phone interview if you’re lying in bed, for example, or if you’re draped over your couch in your pajamas.<br>奇怪的建议？也许。但是，就像在正常面试中一样，关注自己的外表，从心理学的角度来看，会让你处于正确的心态。例如，如果你躺在床上，或者穿着睡衣躺在沙发上，你在电话面试中的表现就不会那么好。</p><p><strong>6. Stand up, or at least sit up straight at a table or desk.</strong><br><strong>6. 站起来，或者至少在桌子或书桌前坐直。</strong></p><p>Again, there’s a psychological, frame of mind aspect to consider here. But on a more tangible level, research has shown that you project yourself better when you’re standing up, and you’ll feel more knowledgeable and confident.<br>同样，这里需要考虑心理、心态方面的因素。但在更具体的层面上，研究表明，当你站起来时，你可以更好地展现自己，你会感到更有知识和自信。</p><p>Phone interviews can be tricky, especially since you aren’t able to read your interviewers’ nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language during the session – a big difference from the typical interview. But if you prepare well for your phone interview, you won’t need to read anyone’s nonverbals to gauge your performance. You’ll know for sure how you’ve done because you’ll be invited to <a href="https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/different-types-of-interviews-canada">a face-to-face interview</a>, where you’ll have yet another opportunity to prove you’re the best person for the job.<br>电话面试可能很棘手，特别是因为你无法在面试过程中阅读面试官的非语言线索，例如面部表情和肢体语言，这与典型的面试有很大不同。但如果你为电话面试做好充分准备，你就不需要阅读任何人的非语言来衡量你的表现。您会确切地知道自己的表现，因为您将被邀请参加面对面的面试，在那里您将有另一个机会证明自己是该职位的最佳人选。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>crib </p><p>tricky</p><p>nonverbals</p><p>cues</p><p>facial expressions </p><p>gauge </p></blockquote><h1 id="END"><a href="#END" class="headerlink" title="END"></a>END</h1>]]></content>

They approach situations by determining the specifications of systems in question, analyzing workflows, and proposing software solutions to address wants and needs. They often work closely with vendors to obtain software licenses, test products, and approve solutions. Depending on the level of their position, software engineers may also work closely with managers or executives in order to establish or meet company goals.<br>软件工程师通过设计和创建软件解决方案为信息系统做出贡献。他们通过确定相关系统的规格、分析工作流程并提出软件解决方案来满足需求来处理情况。他们经常与供应商密切合作以获得软件许可证、测试产品和批准解决方案。根据职位级别，软件工程师还可能与经理或高管密切合作，以建立或实现公司目标。</p><p>A great software engineer resume should include a few essential components. First, list your responsibilities and accomplishments for each previous position while keeping in mind the job that you’re applying for. Discuss projects that you’ve completed while providing specifics about goals you’ve met. Mention languages and programs you’re familiar with to convey the skills you’ve acquired on the job. Since this position typically requires advanced problem-solving skills, be sure to communicate how you approach and address problems.<br>一份优秀的软件工程师简历应该包括一些重要的组成部分。首先，列出您之前每个职位的职责和成就，同时牢记您正在申请的工作。讨论您已完成的项目，同时提供有关您已实现的目标的具体信息。提及您熟悉的语言和程序，以传达您在工作中获得的技能。由于该职位通常需要高级的解决问题的技能，因此请务必传达您如何处理和解决问题。</p><p><strong>Common Mistakes for Software Engineer Resumes</strong><br><strong>软件工程师简历的常见错误</strong></p><p>When you’re compiling your software engineer resume, keep an eye out for some of the most common mistakes. One of the biggest errors that software engineers make is listing general accomplishments without providing specific numbers. Simply mentioning that you’ve created code and designed programs for a company isn’t enough to convey your true accomplishments. Instead, mention what you’ve accomplished, how you’ve done it, and what kind of impact the final product had.<br>当您编写软件工程师简历时，请留意一些最常见的错误。软件工程师犯的最大错误之一是列出一般成就而不提供具体数字。仅仅提及您为一家公司创建了代码并设计了程序并不足以传达您的真实成就。相反，提及你所取得的成就、你是如何做到的以及最终产品产生了什么样的影响。</p><p>Another common resume mistake that software engineers make is failing to specify their skill level. Most candidates already know how important it is to list programming language they know and relevant skills they’ve acquired, but software engineers at all skill levels neglect to indicate where they rank in terms of each area of expertise. Make it easy for potential employers to know where you stand by using terms like “beginner,” “intermediate” or “expert” when you mention languages and skills.<br>软件工程师在简历中犯的另一个常见错误是没有具体说明他们的技能水平。大多数候选人已经知道列出他们所知道的编程语言和他们所获得的相关技能是多么重要，但所有技能水平的软件工程师都忽略了他们在每个专业领域的排名。当您提到语言和技能时，使用“初学者”、“中级”或“专家”等术语，让潜在雇主更容易了解您的立场。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Software-Engineer-Resume-Sample-软件工程师简历样本"><a href="#Software-Engineer-Resume-Sample-软件工程师简历样本" class="headerlink" title="Software Engineer Resume Sample-软件工程师简历样本"></a>Software Engineer Resume Sample-软件工程师简历样本</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Liz Jones</strong><br><strong>莉兹·琼斯</strong><br>123 Main Parkway<br>123主干道<br>Vancouver, BC<br>不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华<br>123-456-789 | <a href="mailto:&#108;&#x69;&#x7a;&#106;&#111;&#110;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#49;&#50;&#x33;&#45;&#52;&#53;&#54;&#45;&#55;&#x38;&#x39;">&#108;&#x69;&#x7a;&#106;&#111;&#110;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#49;&#50;&#x33;&#45;&#52;&#53;&#54;&#45;&#55;&#x38;&#x39;</a> | 123-456-789 <a href="mailto:&#108;&#105;&#122;&#x6a;&#x6f;&#110;&#101;&#115;&#x40;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#108;&#105;&#122;&#x6a;&#x6f;&#110;&#101;&#115;&#x40;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a></p><p>Work Experience<br>工作经验</p><p>2014 - Present2014年至今<br>Vancouver, BC不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华</p><p>Senior Software Engineer | Vancouver Tech Works<br>高级软件工程师|温哥华科技厂</p><ul><li>Use Hybrid Agile development methodology to maintain schedules for product development and testing<br>使用混合敏捷开发方法来维护产品开发和测试的时间表</li><li>Coordinate the efforts of a remote team of 12 members through frequent online communication<br>通过频繁的在线沟通协调由 12 名成员组成的远程团队的工作</li><li>Have applied strong sense of organization and leadership to reduce product development costs by 15 percent<br>运用强烈的组织意识和领导力，将产品开发成本降低了 15%</li></ul><p>2011 - 2014<br>Vancouver, BC<br>不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华</p><p>Software Engineer | BC Development<br>软件工程师| BC发展</p><ul><li>Designed standard frameworks to be reused in future projects<br>设计了可在未来项目中重用的标准框架</li><li>Drove larger software engineering team to adopt cutting-edge software application<br>推动更大的软件工程团队采用尖端的软件应用程序</li><li>Acted as liaison between project team and clients to translate client needs into achievable goals<br>作为项目团队和客户之间的联络人，将客户需求转化为可实现的目标</li></ul><p>2011 - 2012<br>Vancouver, BC<br>不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华</p><p>Web Developer | 123 TECH<br>网页开发人员 | 123 科技</p><ul><li>Created website for upcoming television network The ATLX<br>为即将推出的电视网络 The ATLX 创建网站</li><li>Designed, developed, implemented, and maintained three web applications for clients<br>为客户设计、开发、实施和维护三个 Web 应用程序</li><li>Analyzed user requirements, and translated client needs into application design<br>分析用户需求，并将客户需求转化为应用设计</li></ul><p>Education<br>教育</p><p>2005 - 2009<br>Calgary, AB<br>艾伯塔省卡尔加里</p><p>University of Calgary<br>卡尔加里大学<br><em>B.S.

today.<br>Today, I am going to talk about three things.<br>That is it.<br>We will start with why it is so important to us to have a product that we can make truly available and broadly available to everyone.<br>And we are always trying to find out ways to reduce friction.<br>So everyone can use ChatGPT wherever they are.<br>Today, we will be releasing the desktop version of ChatGPT and to make it simpler to use and much more natural as well.<br>But the big news today is that we are launching our new flagship model.<br>And we are calling it GPT-4o.<br>Best thing about GPT-4o is it brain GPT-4 intelligence to everyone including our free users.<br>We will be showing some live demos today to show the full extent of the capabilities of our new model.<br>And we will be rolling them out over the next few weeks.<br>So let’s get started.<br>A very important part of our mission is to be able to make our advanced AI tools available to everyone for free.<br>We think it is very, very important that people having for what the technology can do.<br>We really want to pair it with its broader understanding.<br>And were always finding ways to reduce the friction.<br>Recently, we made ChatGPT available without the sign-up flow.<br>Today, we are also bringing the best to ChatGPT.<br>We want you to be able to use it wherever you are.<br>As you can see it is easy, simple, it integrates very, very easily in your workflow.<br>Along with it, we have also refreshed the UI.<br>We note that this model get more and more complex.<br>But we want the experience of interaction to actually become more natural, easy, and for you not to focus on the UI at all but focus on the collaboration of ChatGPT.<br>And now the big news.<br>Today, we are releasing our newest flagship model this is GPT-4o.<br>GPT-4o provides GPT-4 intelligence but it is much faster.<br>And it improves on its capabilities across text, vision, and audio.<br>For the past couple of years, we have been very focused on improving the intelligence of this model is.<br>And they have gotten pretty good.<br>But this is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use.<br>This is incredibly important because we are looking at the future of interaction between ourselves and the machines.<br>We think that GPT-4o is really shifting the paradigm into the future of collaboration.<br>It is natural and far easier.<br>Making this happen is actually quite complex.<br>When we interact with one another there is a lot of stuff that we take for granted.<br>You know the ease of our dialogue when we interrupt another, the background noises, the multiple voices in a conversation and understanding the tone of voice.<br>All of these things are quite complex.<br>Until now with voice mode, we had three models that come together to deliver this experience.<br>We have transcription, intelligence, and text to speech all comes together and orchestration to deliver voice mode.<br>This also brings a lot of latency to the experience and it really breaks the immersion in the collaboration with ChatGPT.<br>But now with GPT-4o this all happens natively.<br>GPT-4o reasons across voice, text, and vision.<br>And with this incredible efficiencies, it also allows us to bring the GPT-4o intelligence to our free users.<br>This is something we have been trying to do for many, many months.<br>And we are very, very excited to finally bring GPT-4o to all of our users.<br>Today, we have 100 million people using more than 100 million and fact they use ChatGPT to create work, learn, and we have this advanced tools that are only available to our paid users at least until now with a efficiencies of 4o we can bring these tools to everyone.<br>So starting today, you can use GPT in the GPT store.<br>So far we have had more than a million users create amazing experiences with GPT.<br>This is custom ChatGPT and they are available in the store.<br>And now our builders have much bigger audience where university professors can create content for their students, or pod casters can create content for their listeners.<br>You can also use the vision.<br>So now you can upload screenshots, photos, documents containing both text and images.<br>You can start conversations with ChatGPT about all of this content.<br>You can also use memory where it makes ChatGPT far more useful and helpful because now it has a sense of continuity across all of your conversations.<br>You can use browse where you can search for real-time information in your conversation.<br>An advanced data analysis where you can upload charts and any tools and analyze this information.<br>It will give you answers and so on.<br>Lastly, we also improved on the quality and speed in 50 different languages.<br>For ChatGPT and this is very important because we want to be able to bring this experience to as many people out there as possible.<br>So we are very, very excited to bring GPT-4o to all of our free users out there and for the paid users, they will continue to have up to five times the capacity limits of our free users.<br>But GPT-4o is not only available in ChatGPT.<br>We also bringing you to the API.<br>So our developers can start building today with GPT-4o and making amazing AI applications deploying them at scale. 4o is faster, 50% cheaper and five times higher rate limits to GPT-4 Turbo.<br>As we bring these technologies into the world, it is quite challenging to figure out how to do so in a way that is both useful and also safe.<br>GPT-4o present new challenges for us when it comes to safety because we are dealing with real time audio, real-time vision and our team has been hard at work figuring out how to build in mitigations against misuse.<br>We continue to work with different stakeholders out there from government, media, entertainment, all industries, civil societies to figure out how to best bring this technologies into the world.<br>Over the next few weeks, we will continue our deployment to bring out all of the capabilities to you.<br>But today, I want to show you all of these capabilities.<br>We will do some live demos.<br>I will bring on two of our research leads Mark Chen and Barrett Zoph.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>BARRETT ZOPH: Hi I’m Barrett.<br>MARK CHEN: Hi a mark.<br>One of the key capabilities we are excited to share his real-time conversational speech.<br>Will get in Florida.<br>I am taking out a phone if you’re wondering about this wire we have consistent Internet.<br>If you see there’s this little icon on the bottom right of the ChatGPT out.<br>It will open GPT-4o audio capabilities.<br>Hey, ChatGPT hi Mark how are you?<br>CHAT GPT: Hello Mark I am doing great thanks for asking.<br>How about you?<br>MARK CHEN: I am on stage right now and I’m doing a live demo and I am a little bit nervous.<br>Can you help me, nerves a little bit?<br>CHAT GPT: You’re doing a live demo right now?<br>That is awesome.<br>Just take a deep breath and remember you are the expert here.<br>MARK CHEN: I like the suggestion let me try a couple of deep breaths.<br>Can you give me feedback on my breath?<br>Here I go.<br>CHAT GPT: Wold slow down.<br>Mark, you are not a vacuum cleaner.<br>MARK CHEN: Let me try again.<br>I am going to breathe in deeply and breathe out.<br>CHAT GPT: Exhale slowly.<br>MARK CHEN: I will try again.<br>Breathing in and breathe out.<br>CHAT GPT: That is it.<br>How do you feel?<br>MARK CHEN: I feel a lot better, thank you so much.<br>MIRA MURATI: Mark, you have been working on these capabilities for a while can you tell us how it is different from voice mode?<br>MARK CHEN: If you use the voice mode express before you will notice a couple of key differences.<br>First you cannot interrupt the model you do not have to wait to you finish your term before you can start speaking.<br>You could but in whenever you want.<br>Second, the model is real-time responsiveness.<br>That means that you do not have this awkward two Ãthree second lag before you waitwait for the model to get a response.<br>Finally the model picks up on a motion.<br>When I was breathing super hard, you can tell.<br>Hey, you may want to calm down a little bit.<br>You are running a little bit too fast.<br>It really has that capability across the board to procedure emotion.<br>Not only that the model is able to generate voice in a variety of different styles.<br>It really has a wide dynamic range.<br>I want to fire another demo.<br>Hey, ChatGPT how are you doing?<br>CHAT GPT: Am doing fantastic, thanks for asking.<br>How about you?<br>MARK CHEN: My friend Barrett he has been having problems sleeping lately.<br>I want you to tell them a bedtime story about robots in love.<br>CHAT GPT: A bedtime story about robots and love?<br>I got you covered.<br>Gather around Barrett.<br>Once upon a time in the world not too different from ours there was a robot named bite.<br>Bite was a curious robot always exploring<br>MARK CHEN: I want a little bit emotion in your voice a little bit more drama.<br>CHAT GPT: Got it.<br>Let’s add some drama.<br>Once upon a time in a world not too different from ours there was a robot named bite.<br>MARK CHEN: I want maximum expression.<br>CHAT GPT: That’s amplified the drama.<br>Once upon a time in a world not too different from ours there was a robot named bite.<br>MIRA MURATI: Can you do this in a robotic voice now?<br>CHAT GPT: Initiating dramatic robotic voice.<br>Once upon a time in a world not too different from ours there was a robot named bite.<br>Bite was a curious robot.<br>Always exploring<br>MARK CHEN: Can you do the story and a singing voice?<br>CHAT GPT: And so bite found another robot friend and they lived circularly ever after.<br>MARK CHEN: I definitely feel a lot more relaxed.<br>MIRA MURATI: You have just seen the voice capabilities but we also want to show you division capabilities as the model can also see the world around us.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: You can chat with ChatGPT and you can interact with it as well.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Let me boot up ChatGPT.<br>Hey, ChatGPT.<br>CHAT GPT: Hello there how’s it going?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: It’s going really well and I would like your help solving a math problem.<br>CHAT GPT: What math problem can help you tackle today?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to write down a linear equation on a sheet of paper and I will love help working through it.<br>Don’t tell me the solution does give me hints along the way.<br>CHAT GPT: Got it.<br>Okay, I see it.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: I did not show you yet.<br>One second.<br>CHAT GPT: I got to excited.<br>I am ready when you are.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: ChatGPT what equation did not write down?<br>CHAT GPT: I see it now.<br>You wrote down 3X +1 equals four.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Exactly.<br>What is the first step to solve this?<br>CHAT GPT: The first step is to get all of the terms with X on one side and the constants on the other side.<br>So what do you think we should do with that +1?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to try to submitsubtract one from both sides and see what I get.<br>CHAT GPT: Great idea.<br>Perfect.<br>Now what do you get when you subtract one from both sides?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so ChatGPT this is what I ended up with.<br>How does this look?<br>CHAT GPT: Spot on.<br>Now you have isolated the term with X on one side and it looks like 3X equals three.<br>What do you think we should do next to solve for X?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: I’m not sure can you give me another hint?<br>CHAT GPT: Of course.<br>You have 3X and you want to find the value of X.<br>Think about what operation with undue multiplication?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Is it subtraction?<br>CHAT GPT: Close but think about the opposite of multiplication because 3X equals three times X.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Okay I think it is division.<br>Let me try to divide both sides by three and see what I get.<br>CHAT GPT: Bingo.<br>Go and head and divide both sides by three.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so ChatGPT this is what I ended up with.<br>How does this look?<br>CHAT GPT: Looks perfect.<br>You have solved it.<br>X equals one.<br>Nicely done.<br>How do you feel about solving linear equations now?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Honestly,<br>MARK CHEN: Am not confident that I can solve new equations.<br>Why would you need this in the real world?<br>CHAT GPT: That is of her questions.<br>Linear equations pop up in a lot of everyday situations.<br>Even if we do not realize it.<br>For example calculating expenses, planning travel, cooking, and even in business for profit and loss calculations.<br>It is a way to solve problems but you need to find an unknown value.<br>MARK CHEN: Have a lot of unknown values in my life.<br>I’m totally convinced that I’m going to learn math now.<br>CHAT GPT: I love the attitude.<br>Math can help solve some of life ministries.<br>Whenever you to die the more math I am here for you.<br>Anything else you like to tackle today?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: I love that you taught my friend Mark that I would have something I would like you to take a look at.<br>CHAT GPT: I would love to see what you wrote.<br>Show it to me whenever you’re ready.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: This is what I wrote down what do you see?<br>CHAT GPT: I see I love ChatGPT.<br>That is so sweet of you.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: I really appreciate all the help.<br>CHAT GPT: That is quite outfit you have on.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: We can chat in real-time with ChatGPT.<br>We can interact with video as well.<br>MARK CHEN: If you look at Barrett’s it’s all equations like this.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>MIRA MURATI: Now that you know you can do linear equations can you show us something more complex?<br>MARK CHEN: Let me take a computer out for this.<br>I am want to open the ChatGPT app.<br>And to get background on what is going on so here we have a computer on the screen we have some cold.<br>And then the ChatGPT is on this side.<br>It can hear me but can’t see anything on the screen.<br>I’m going to highlight the code and I will send it to ChatGPT.<br>I’m going to talk about the code.<br>Hey, ChatGPT.<br>CHAT GPT: Hey, there how’s it going?<br>Of course I would love to help you.<br>What is the coding problem you’re dealing with?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to share with you some code.<br>One second.<br>CHAT GPT: Sure thing, take your time.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: I just shared code with you.<br>Can you give me a one sentence description of what is going on in the code?<br>CHAT GPT: Infectious daily weather for specific location for time period for data using a rolling average and annotates a significant weather event on the resulting plot and displays the plot with the average minimum and maximum temperatures over the year.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Awesome, thanks so much.<br>In the code there’s this function Fu.<br>Can you thiscan you tell me what it would be if I did not have this function?<br>CHAT GPT: The function Fu takes a data frame X taking temperature data and a window sized Y for calculating the rolling name.<br>It is smooths the average temperature, minimum temperature and maximum temperature columns by applying a rolling mean over the specified window.<br>With the Fu function the plot which showed smoother temperature lines because the rolling mean reduces the noise or fluctuations in the data.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Awesome, thanks much.<br>I will want to apply this function.<br>I am going to generate the plot and show it to you.<br>Give me one second.<br>CHAT GPT: Absolutely.<br>Take your time.<br>I’m excited to see the plot when you’re ready.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: So far ChatGPT have been able to see the cold and now and go to run it and use the vision capabilities of the ChatGPT app so it can see everything going on in the screen as well.<br>Okay ChatGPT I am sharing with you the plot now.<br>I’m wondering if you give me a brief one sentence overview of what you see.<br>CHAT GPT: Plot displays smooth average minimum and maximum temperatures throughout 2018 with a notable annotation marking a big rainfall event in late September.<br>BARRETT ZOPH:<br>MARK CHEN: What months do you see the hot temperatures?<br>CHAT GPT: The hottest temperatures occur around July and August.<br>The maximum temperature during these months is roughly between 25B0 and 30B 77B0 Fahrenheit Ã86B0F.<br>MIRA MURATI: What is going on with the Y axis is this in Celsius to Fahrenheit?<br>CHAT GPT: The Y axis is in Celsius.<br>The temperatures are labeled accordingly such as average temperature, minimum temperature and maximum temperature.<br>MARK CHEN:<br>BARRETT ZOPH: It can help interact with code and see the outputs of plots and everything that is going on on the computer.<br>MIRA MURATI: A few minutes ago we asked a live audience on asked to submit a request for what they would like us to try out.<br>I will take a couple of prompts.<br>They want to know if GPT-4o is capable of real-time translation?<br>Mark do you want to try this one?<br>MARK CHEN: Sure, let’s do it.<br>Hey, ChatGPT how are you?<br>CHAT GPT: I am doing fantastic.<br>Thanks for asking.<br>How are you are your day going?<br>MARK CHEN: I would like you to function as a translator.<br>Have a friend that only speaks Italian and I only speak English.<br>Every time you hear English I want you to translate it to its value.<br>If you hear Italian I want you to translate it back to English.<br>CHAT GPT: Perfect.<br>MIRA MURATI: [speaking In Italian ]CHAT GPT: If Wells can talk what would they tell us?<br>MARK CHEN: They may ask how do we solve linear equations?<br>CHAT GPT: [speaking In Italian]MIRA MURATI: [speaking In Italian]CHAT GPT: Certainly, yes.<br>MARK CHEN: Great, it looks like it works.<br>MIRA MURATI: The next one is from John who asked can you tell what you’re feeling just by looking at your face?<br>Barrett do you want to give this one a try?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Absolutely let’s give it a try.<br>Hey, ChatGPT.<br>CHAT GPT: Hey, there what is up?<br>How can I bring your day today?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: I’m going to show you a selfie of what I look like and then I would like you to try to see what emotions I am feeling based on how I’m looking.<br>CHAT GPT: Sounds like a fun challenge.<br>Go ahead and show me the selfie and I will put my emotional detective hat on.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so here is me.<br>What kind of emotions am I doing?<br>CHAT GPT: It seems like I am looking at a picture of a wooden surface.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: That was the thing I sent you before I’m not actually a table.<br>Take another look.<br>CHAT GPT: That makes more sense.<br>There we go.<br>It looks like you’re feeling pretty happy and cheerful.<br>With a big smile and maybe a touch of excitement.<br>Whatever is going on, it seems like you are in a great mood.<br>Care to share the source of the device?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: The reason I’m in a good mood is we are doing a presentation showcasing how useful and amazing you are.<br>CHAT GPT: Oh stop it, you’re making me blush.<br>MIRA MURATI: Amazing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That is it for today on live demos.<br>As you can see this feels so magical.<br>It is wonderful but we also want to remove some of the mysticism from the technology and bring it to you so you can try it for yourself.<br>Over the next few weeks, we will be rolling out these capabilities to everyone.<br>Today has been very much focused on the free users and the new modalities and new products.<br>But we also care a lot about the next frontier.<br>So soon we will be updating you on our progress towards the next big thing.<br>And before we wrap up, I just want to thank the incredible OpenAI team and thanks to Janssen and Nvidia team for bringing us the advanced GPU to make this demo possible today.<br>And thank you all very, very much for being a part of this today.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>MIRA MURATI: Hi everyone.<br>Thank you, thank you.<br>It is great to have you here today.<br>Today, I am going to talk about three things.<br>That is it.<br>We will start with why it is so important to us to have a product that we can make truly available and broadly available to everyone.<br>And we are always trying to find out ways to reduce friction.<br>So everyone can use ChatGPT wherever they are.<br>Today, we will be releasing the desktop version of ChatGPT and to make it simpler to use and much more natural as well.<br>But the big news today is that we are launching our new flagship model.<br>And we are calling it GPT-4o.<br>Best thing about GPT-4o is it brain GPT-4 intelligence to everyone including our free users.<br>We will be showing some live demos today to show the full extent of the capabilities of our new model.<br>And we will be rolling them out over the next few weeks.<br>So let’s get started.<br>A very important part of our mission is to be able to make our advanced AI tools available to everyone for free.<br>We think it is very, very important that people having for what the technology can do.<br>We really want to pair it with its broader understanding.<br>And were always finding ways to reduce the friction.<br>Recently, we made ChatGPT available without the sign-up flow.<br>Today, we are also bringing the best to ChatGPT.<br>We want you to be able to use it wherever you are.<br>As you can see it is easy, simple, it integrates very, very easily in your workflow.<br>Along with it, we have also refreshed the UI.<br>We note that this model get more and more complex.<br>But we want the experience of interaction to actually become more natural, easy, and for you not to focus on the UI at all but focus on the collaboration of ChatGPT.<br>And now the big news.<br>Today, we are releasing our newest flagship model this is GPT-4o.<br>GPT-4o provides GPT-4 intelligence but it is much faster.<br>And it improves on its capabilities across text, vision, and audio.<br>For the past couple of years, we have been very focused on improving the intelligence of this model is.<br>And they have gotten pretty good.<br>But this is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use.<br>This is incredibly important because we are looking at the future of interaction between ourselves and the machines.<br>We think that GPT-4o is really shifting the paradigm into the future of collaboration.<br>It is natural and far easier.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Making this happen is actually quite complex.<br>When we interact with one another there is a lot of stuff that we take for granted.<br>You know the ease of our dialogue when we interrupt another, the background noises, the multiple voices in a conversation and understanding the tone of voice.<br>All of these things are quite complex.<br>Until now with voice mode, we had three models that come together to deliver this experience.<br>We have transcription, intelligence, and text to speech all comes together and orchestration to deliver voice mode.<br>This also brings a lot of latency to the experience and it really breaks the immersion in the collaboration with ChatGPT.<br>But now with GPT-4o this all happens natively.<br>GPT-4o reasons across voice, text, and vision.<br>And with this incredible efficiencies, it also allows us to bring the GPT-4o intelligence to our free users.<br>This is something we have been trying to do for many, many months.<br>And we are very, very excited to finally bring GPT-4o to all of our users.<br>Today, we have 100 million people using more than 100 million and fact they use ChatGPT to create work, learn, and we have this advanced tools that are only available to our paid users at least until now with a efficiencies of 4o we can bring these tools to everyone.<br>So starting today, you can use GPT in the GPT store.<br>So far we have had more than a million users create amazing experiences with GPT.<br>This is custom ChatGPT and they are available in the store.<br>And now our builders have much bigger audience where university professors can create content for their students, or pod casters can create content for their listeners.<br>You can also use the vision.<br>So now you can upload screenshots, photos, documents containing both text and images.<br>You can start conversations with ChatGPT about all of this content.<br>You can also use memory where it makes ChatGPT far more useful and helpful because now it has a sense of continuity across all of your conversations.<br>You can use browse where you can search for real-time information in your conversation.<br>An advanced data analysis where you can upload charts and any tools and analyze this information.<br>It will give you answers and so on.<br>Lastly, we also improved on the quality and speed in 50 different languages.<br>For ChatGPT and this is very important because we want to be able to bring this experience to as many people out there as possible.<br>So we are very, very excited to bring GPT-4o to all of our free users out there and for the paid users, they will continue to have up to five times the capacity limits of our free users.<br>But GPT-4o is not only available in ChatGPT.<br>We also bringing you to the API.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So our developers can start building today with GPT-4o and making amazing AI applications deploying them at scale.<br>4o is faster, 50% cheaper and five times higher rate limits to GPT-4 Turbo.<br>As we bring these technologies into the world, it is quite challenging to figure out how to do so in a way that is both useful and also safe.<br>GPT-4o present new challenges for us when it comes to safety because we are dealing with real time audio, real-time vision and our team has been hard at work figuring out how to build in mitigations against misuse.<br>We continue to work with different stakeholders out there from government, media, entertainment, all industries, civil societies to figure out how to best bring this technologies into the world.<br>Over the next few weeks, we will continue our deployment to bring out all of the capabilities to you.<br>But today, I want to show you all of these capabilities.<br>We will do some live demos.<br>I will bring on two of our research leads Mark Chen and Barrett Zoph.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Hi I’m Barrett.<br>MARK CHEN: Hi a mark.<br>One of the key capabilities we are excited to share his real-time conversational speech.<br>Will get in Florida.<br>I am taking out a phone if you’re wondering about this wire we have consistent Internet.<br>If you see there’s this little icon on the bottom right of the ChatGPT out.<br>It will open GPT-4o audio capabilities.<br>Hey, ChatGPT hi Mark how are you?<br>CHAT GPT: Hello Mark I am doing great thanks for asking.<br>How about you?<br>MARK CHEN: I am on stage right now and I’m doing a live demo and I am a little bit nervous.<br>Can you help me, nerves a little bit?<br>CHAT GPT: You’re doing a live demo right now?<br>That is awesome.<br>Just take a deep breath and remember you are the expert here.<br>MARK CHEN: I like the suggestion let me try a couple of deep breaths.<br>Can you give me feedback on my breath?<br>Here I go.<br>CHAT GPT: Wold slow down.<br>Mark, you are not a vacuum cleaner.<br>MARK CHEN: Let me try again.<br>I am going to breathe in deeply and breathe out.<br>CHAT GPT: Exhale slowly.<br>MARK CHEN: I will try again.<br>Breathing in and breathe out.<br>CHAT GPT: That is it.<br>How do you feel?<br>MARK CHEN: I feel a lot better, thank you so much.<br>MIRA MURATI: Mark, you have been working on these capabilities for a while can you tell us how it is different from voice mode?<br>MARK CHEN: If you use the voice mode express before you will notice a couple of key differences.<br>First you cannot interrupt the model you do not have to wait to you finish your term before you can start speaking.<br>You could but in whenever you want.<br>Second, the model is real-time responsiveness.<br>That means that you do not have this awkward two Ãthree second lag before you waitwait for the model to get a response.<br>Finally the model picks up on a motion.<br>When I was breathing super hard, you can tell.<br>Hey, you may want to calm down a little bit.<br>You are running a little bit too fast.<br>It really has that capability across the board to procedure emotion.<br>Not only that the model is able to generate voice in a variety of different styles.<br>It really has a wide dynamic range.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I want to fire another demo.<br>Hey, ChatGPT how are you doing?<br>CHAT GPT: Am doing fantastic, thanks for asking.<br>How about you?<br>MARK CHEN: My friend Barrett he has been having problems sleeping lately.<br>I want you to tell them a bedtime story about robots in love.<br>CHAT GPT: A bedtime story about robots and love?<br>I got you covered.<br>Gather around Barrett.<br>Once upon a time in the world not too different from ours there was a robot named bite.<br>Bite was a curious robot always exploring<br>MARK CHEN: I want a little bit emotion in your voice a little bit more drama.<br>CHAT GPT: Got it.<br>Let’s add some drama.<br>Once upon a time in a world not too different from ours there was a robot named bite.<br>MARK CHEN: I want maximum expression.<br>CHAT GPT: That’s amplified the drama.<br>Once upon a time in a world not too different from ours there was a robot named bite.<br>MIRA MURATI: Can you do this in a robotic voice now?<br>CHAT GPT: Initiating dramatic robotic voice.<br>Once upon a time in a world not too different from ours there was a robot named bite.<br>Bite was a curious robot.<br>Always exploring<br>MARK CHEN: Can you do the story and a singing voice?<br>CHAT GPT: And so bite found another robot friend and they lived circularly ever after.<br>MARK CHEN: I definitely feel a lot more relaxed.<br>MIRA MURATI: You have just seen the voice capabilities but we also want to show you division capabilities as the model can also see the world around us.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: You can chat with ChatGPT and you can interact with it as well.<br>Let me boot up ChatGPT.<br>Hey, ChatGPT.<br>CHAT GPT: Hello there how’s it going?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: It’s going really well and I would like your help solving a math problem.<br>CHAT GPT: What math problem can help you tackle today?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to write down a linear equation on a sheet of paper and I will love help working through it.<br>Don’t tell me the solution does give me hints along the way.<br>CHAT GPT: Got it.<br>Okay, I see it.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: I did not show you yet.<br>One second.<br>CHAT GPT: I got to excited.<br>I am ready when you are.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: ChatGPT what equation did not write down?<br>CHAT GPT: I see it now.<br>You wrote down 3X +1 equals four.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Exactly.<br>What is the first step to solve this?<br>CHAT GPT: The first step is to get all of the terms with X on one side and the constants on the other side.<br>So what do you think we should do with that +1?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to try to submitsubtract one from both sides and see what I get.<br>CHAT GPT: Great idea.<br>Perfect.<br>Now what do you get when you subtract one from both sides?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so ChatGPT this is what I ended up with.<br>How does this look?<br>CHAT GPT: Spot on.<br>Now you have isolated the term with X on one side and it looks like 3X equals three.<br>What do you think we should do next to solve for X?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: I’m not sure can you give me another hint?<br>CHAT GPT: Of course.<br>You have 3X and you want to find the value of X.<br>Think about what operation with undue multiplication?<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Is it subtraction?<br>CHAT GPT: Close but think about the opposite of multiplication because 3X equals three times X.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Okay I think it is division.<br>Let me try to divide both sides by three and see what I get.<br>CHAT GPT: Bingo.<br>Go and head and divide both sides by three.<br>BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so ChatGPT this is what I ended up with.<br>How does this look?<br>CHAT GPT: Looks perfect.<br>You have solved it.<br>X equals one.<br>Nicely done.<br>How do you feel about solving linear equations now?<br>BARRETT ZOPH:

title="English"></a>English</h4><blockquote><p>My story starts in Moscow.I was 15 years old.<br>My best friend and I, we were part of a group of Westerners,visiting the Soviet Union.This was in 1987,a few years before the fall of the communist regime.<br>We were given an official tour guide who was assigned to us.<br>And the tour would start in the morning,and we were checked in to our hotel rooms for the night.<br>My friend said to me, ‘’Let’s go outside and look at the city.’’<br>I thought it was a great idea.<br>Dumb idea.<br>So we grabbed our coats, and we snuck out past security and into the street.<br>We found the entrance to the metro.<br>The Moscow underground transportation system is the deepest one in the world.<br>The ride down the escalator took a full minute.<br>Once we were down there, my friend headed right to an open train,and I pulled him back and said, ‘Wait!<br>Let’s write down the name of the station so we can find our way back.’So I had a notepad, and I took a notepad,and I wrote down the letters of the station,and we hopped down the train and went on train hopping.<br>And that was fun because -Well, actually, it was weird.<br>There were a lot of people, probably all coming home from work.<br>They were all dressed in brown and gray clothes,and it looked very, very different from what we were used to at home.<br>But the stations were lovely.<br>There were stations with statues, with paintings on the wall,and glass displays.<br>It was really like museums.<br>We would never have expected that.<br>And everything was perfectly clean.<br>Well,what was weird though is that the people - nobody seemed to speak,and everyone seemed to be looking at us and it kind of weirded us out.<br>So after about 20-30 minutes,we’d had enough and we wanted to go home.<br>I showed my note to someone and they directed me over there.<br>Then over there, I showed my note to another person,and they directed us to the other way.<br>And then a third person directed us sideways.<br>That was a little confusing.<br>Aw, then I saw it.<br>Over the stairs, the sign.<br>It turned out I had written down the Russian word for ‘Exit.’So we headed upstairs and we found a taxi.<br>That was great.<br>And we told the driver, you know, ‘Intourist Hotel,’and then he was willing to take us.<br>And I remember sitting next to the driver, handing him 50 rubles.<br>And he looked at me and he said,(Russian) No, dollar!<br>Fifty dollars?<br>That was like I don’t know 20 times that amount or something.<br>That was not an option for us.<br>So we had to get out of the taxi,and he drove away, leaving us standing there.<br>It was a cold night,and you know everything was strange for us,and we were teenagers,and we were pretty nervous, didn’t know what to do.<br>Well, we started walking.<br>We walked to the end of the block.<br>We turned the corner.<br>And 200 yards in front of us, the Intourist Hotel.Well, this experience affected me in two ways.<br>The first is that anytime after this trip that I would hear anyone speak Russian,I was just cringe.<br>And the second one is that it taught me the importanceof understanding the local language when you’re traveling.<br>And it actually led to me learning another four languages fluentlyover the following years.<br>Now, before I go on, I’d like to know in the audience -Can we have a little bit of light maybe in the audience?<br>I’d just like to know who’s -By a show of hands, who is not a native English speaker?<br>It must be 99%.<br>Anyone who doesn’t speak English, stand up!<br>Alright, so I can assumeall of you have, you know, gone through the process of learning a language.<br>Anybody who speaks three or more languages?<br>Wow, that’s maybe 70%.<br>Four or more languages, anyone?<br>That’s still quite a bit.<br>Anyone speak five or more languages?<br>Wow, come see me during the break.<br>To me, learning a language is…<br>For me, it’s like a deck of playing cards lying faced down on the table.<br>As you start learning and understanding, the cards start opening up for you.<br>Now there’s no standard way of classifying this.<br>But as you learn, you reach certain milestones.<br>And the first one would be when about 25% of the cards are turned up,you reach like a basic level.<br>At this level, you have a base vocabulary, some grammar,and you’re able to have maybe very simple conversationsand communicate a little bit.<br>And your study goes on until you reach this magical point of fluency,what we call being fluent in the language.<br>Now what does it mean, being fluent in a language?<br>It means that you’ve turned up more than 50% of the cards in the deck,and that is the point where you have -where the language becomes part of your subconsciousso that even if you don’t use it anymore for 10 years or longer,you will not forget it.<br>You can get back into it within a very, very short time.<br>So this is a level where you’re comfortable thinking in a language,and comfortable communicating in a language.<br>Now, some people go on and, you know, reach like a mastery level.<br>By that time, you know classic literature in the other languageand have maybe in-depth knowledge of specialized fields.<br>That’s often the point taken in academia.<br>For me, when I learned my first foreign language,I had a head startbecause I was born to a German-speaking mother and an American father.<br>Now, when I was a baby, I didn’t really understandthat what my parents were speaking to me were two separate languages.<br>But by the time I was two years old, I had figured it all out.<br>Women speak only German.Men only speak English.Imagine the fun my parents had when they introduced me to couples.<br>Being a bilingual was actually pretty helpful in learning my first language.<br>It definitely helped.<br>If you’re -But it also gave me something else.<br>It gave me two identities and the ability to switch between them.<br>When you’re a native speaker of more than one language,then your personality, your humor, your value system,they change as you switch languages.<br>This can have huge advantages.<br>I mean, some studies have shown an increased problem-solving abilityor even a higher resistance to Alzheimer’s disease.<br>But what I’m almost interested inis that it’s actually given me a lot of social benefits.<br>When you’re a native speaker,then you feel at home among native speakers or in a culture,and also native speakers accept you as one of theirs.<br>Now is this only relevant to native speakers?<br>And that’s the big question.<br>But wouldn’t it be coolif a person learning a foreign language could actually develop another identityand actually enjoy the social benefits of a native speakerthat go beyond communication skills?<br>Well, that’s what happened to me.<br>I was able to do that,and I want to show you from my experience how I think this can be achieved.<br>So if we say this green area here is the level of the native speaker,the first thing to note is that on your way to reaching fluency,there is not really any shortcut.<br>There are some methods that you can use such as the Burrito Principlewhere you identify 20% of the most effective materials to study.<br>There are some apps, like stuff for time-spaced learning,that increase vocabulary retention.<br>They save a little time,but in the end, there’s no way around working with the material, practicing it,until you reach the fluency level.<br>But the second thing to noteis that going from fluency to mastery is a much slower process,and it requires proportionally more effort.<br>That’s why most people - they just stop at fluency.<br>They know how to speak English, good enough,and they don’t even attempt to venture on,and I can understand it.<br>But the good news is,to get the benefits of a native speaker, at a native-speaker level,you don’t have to go through mastery in the academic sense.<br>In fact, you can skip this step altogether.<br>So if you think about it,there are many native speakers do not have an in-depth knowledgeof specialized fields or sophisticated vocabulary.<br>So, that’s not really what is required.<br>So how do you do it?<br>What is required?<br>Well,I want to give you three areas to focus onwhen you’re learning and interacting with native speakers.<br>The first is: work on eliminating your accent.<br>I’m aware I said eliminating.<br>It should be at least minimizing it.<br>This is, in my opinion, the most overlooked aspectof language learning today,but it’s also the most important oneto reach what I call a native-speaker level or a speaker-like level.<br>If you communicate without an accent or almost without an accent,this changes how natives behave towards you unconsciously,and it also gives you an ability to adapt to a new self-image.<br>The best way that I’ve found -the best exercise I’ve found to improve your pronunciationis what I call the perfect-sentence technique.<br>What you do is you find a native speaker to help you,and you take a book in the foreign language,you open it at a random page,and you read the first sentence.<br>Then, you ask a native speaker to rate youon obvious accent, slight accent, no accent.<br>Then the native speaker will read this sentence back to you.<br>You have to listen carefully and then you repeat.<br>And you repeat this process over and over until the native speaker tells youthat he can no longer hear an accent when you read the sentence.<br>Now, I realize it can take a very long timeeven just to get one sentence right.<br>But I promise youif you are persistent, and if you patiently work on this,you’ll be amazed by what happens to your accent.<br>The second area to focus on is using verbs and expressions that locals use.<br>Now, we all know the situation that vocabulary can be region-specific.<br>Like, in the US, you use ‘stand in line.’In the UK, you ‘queue.’That’s all good.<br>But sometimes, the spoken word is so different,the speech is so different from what you get in textbooks,that the books are almost useless if you want to converse with natives.<br>I want to give you an example.<br>In the French language, there are words like ‘le travail,’which is ‘my work.’A French person talking to his friend would probably say ‘mon boulot,’which is a completely different word.<br>The same for ‘the clothes,’ ‘le vestments,’but you’ll hear ‘le fringues.’Or money is ‘l’argent,’but people say ‘le fric,’ ‘le sou,’ or many other expressions for this.<br>So, obviously I’m only scratching the surface here.<br>But here you actually have to learn all of these words and expressions one by one.<br>And of course, you have to interact with natives to do that.<br>But after you reach a critical mass that you’re comfortable with,it’ll actually be easier when you encounter something new.<br>You’ll just pick it up in one go, like native speakers would,who hear words or expressions that they didn’t know before.<br>The third area to work on is adopting cultural traits.<br>What do I mean by that?<br>So let me ask you:what does this gesture mean to you?<br>Any Italians here?<br>OK, now, depending on what culture you’re from,this could mean something rude,or it could just mean it’s something incredulous,like, ‘Why did you do that?’<br>Or, ‘How could you?’<br>Or it could just be signaling food, ‘Give me food!’<br>Interesting!<br>In the Middle East,this is just a standard way of signaling ‘Please, wait!’<br>So these kind of traits you have to internalize,and sometimes, they’re hard to spot,and it takes a lot of active listening.<br>I want to give you a few more examples.<br>So imagine I am with three of my friends: an American, a German, and a Frenchman.And, like, we’re walking and maybe the American bumps his head,and his initial reaction might be, ‘Ouch!’<br>That’s how you say it in English.But the German that, you know, gets, I don’t know, elbowed in the crowd,he would say, ‘Ow-ah!’<br>And the French person might step on the nail and say, ‘Ay!’<br>So this, of course, in your target language,this is something you have to observe and also internalize,and it has to become part of you.<br>If…<br>Again I’m with these three friends, and I sit with them,and let’s say I serve them tea,and I ask the American, ‘Would you like a biscuit with your tea?’<br>And if he answers in the affirmative, he might say, ‘Uh-huh!’<br>And I can ask the German, ‘Do you know what tea this is?’<br>He’ll say, ‘’Mm- hmm!’’<br>And then I ask the Frenchman, ‘Do you like this?’<br>He’ll say, ‘Hmm!’So these difference, they really require active listening.<br>So all of these three things that I told youwhich is pronunciation,and colloquial speech and adopting cultural traits,they all require that you interact with natives as much as possible.<br>Ideally, you should fully immerse yourself in the culture.<br>Now if you have the chance to live abroad for a while, that will be great.<br>Or maybe live among natives in your hometown.<br>Perhaps just have a romantic relationship,or even just spend time, you know, with co-workers.<br>So, romantic relationships, I could do a whole talk about that.<br>That works really well for these things.<br>But yeah -So this will be different for everybody, of course.<br>But even when you’re not around natives, your learning must not stop.<br>Because what you can do is you can watch TV shows and films,you can mimic the characters,you can write down anything that you haven’t heard of before,and practice that.<br>I also want to encourage you to learn the lyrics of songs.<br>Songs are really great because they tell stories.<br>And they not only help your pronunciation when you sing them,but if they’re emotional,they can anchor these expressions into your active vocabulary.<br>And it’s like speaking all day and really using the expressions unconsciously.<br>It’s a great way.<br>So music, definitely.<br>The other thing you need to move towards native-speaker statusis the right mindset,and a belief that if you sound like a native,express yourself like a native,talk like a native and act like a native,you’ll actually achieve a native-like level.<br>So if I could only leave you with one thing today,it would be: work on your pronunciation.<br>Because pronunciationhelps any stage of the learning process,even in the very beginning.<br>It’ll speed up everything.<br>And it also is the key to reaching a native-speaker level,or almost-native-speaker status.<br>So before I go,I’d like to tell you how I was able to overcome my fear of the Russian language.<br>It was a very, very elegant solution.<br>I married a Russian girl.<br>And I now have little kids in my home that speak Russian to me every day.<br>So I want to thank you.<br>(Applause)<br>And before I go, I just want to wish you(Spanish) A lot of success with your language studies.<br>(French)<br>It was a pleasure to present for you today.<br>(Hebrew)<br>I wish you lots of success with your studies.<br>(Yiddish)<br>Thank you for listening.<br>Good luck to you all and…<br>(Russian)<br>Thank you.<br>(Applause)</p></blockquote><h4

old.<br>我的故事从莫斯科开始，当时我15岁。</p><p>My best friend and I, we were part of a group of Westerners,visiting the Soviet Union.This was in 1987,a few years before the fall of the communist regime.<br>我和我最好的朋友，我们是一群西方人的一部分，访问苏联，那是在1987年，共产主义政权垮台前几年。</p><p>We were given an official tour guide who was assigned to us.<br>我们得到了一位分配给我们的官方导游。</p><p>And the tour would start in the morning,and we were checked in to our hotel rooms for the night.<br>旅行将在早上开始，我们被登记入住了我们的酒店房间过夜。</p><p>My friend said to me, ‘’Let’s go outside and look at the city.’’<br>我的朋友对我说，’我们到外面去看看这个城市吧。</p><p>I thought it was a great idea.<br>我认为这是个好主意。</p><p>Dumb idea.<br>愚蠢的想法。</p><p>So we grabbed our coats, and we snuck out past security and into the street.<br>于是，我们拿起外套，偷偷溜出安检，走到街上。</p><p>We found the entrance to the metro.<br>我们找到了地铁的入口。</p><p>The Moscow underground transportation system is the deepest one in the world.<br>莫斯科的地下交通系统是世界上最深的地下交通系统。</p><p>The ride down the escalator took a full minute.<br>乘坐自动扶梯花了整整一分钟。</p><p>Once we were down there, my friend headed right to an open train,and I pulled him back and said, ‘Wait!<br>我们一到那里，我的朋友就直奔一辆敞篷火车，我把他拉回来，说，’等等！</p><p>Let’s write down the name of the station so we can find our way back.’So I had a notepad, and I took a notepad,and I wrote down the letters of the station,and we hopped down the train and went on train hopping.<br>于是我拿了一个记事本，拿了一个记事本，写下了车站的字母，然后我们跳下火车，继续跳火车。</p><p>And that was fun because -Well, actually, it was weird.<br>这很有趣，因为——嗯，实际上，这很奇怪。</p><p>There were a lot of people, probably all coming home from work.<br>有很多人，可能都下班回家了。</p><p>They were all dressed in brown and gray clothes,and it looked very, very different from what we were used to at home.<br>他们都穿着棕色和灰色的衣服，看起来和我们在家里习惯的衣服非常非常不同。</p><p>But the stations were lovely.<br>但是车站很可爱。</p><p>There were stations with statues, with paintings on the wall,and glass displays.<br>有雕像的车站，墙上有画，还有玻璃展示。</p><p>It was really like museums.<br>这真的像博物馆。</p><p>We would never have expected that.<br>我们从未预料到这一点。</p><p>And everything was perfectly clean.<br>一切都很干净。</p><p>Well,what was weird though is that the people - nobody seemed to speak,and everyone seemed to be looking at us and it kind of weirded us out.<br>好吧，奇怪的是，人们似乎没有人说话，每个人似乎都在看着我们，这让我们有点奇怪。</p><p>So after about 20-30 minutes,we’d had enough and we wanted to go home.<br>所以大约20-30分钟后，我们受够了，我们想回家。</p><p>I showed my note to someone and they directed me over there.<br>我把我的纸条给别人看，他们把我带到了那里。</p><p>Then over there, I showed my note to another person,and they directed us to the other way.<br>然后在那里，我把我的纸条给另一个人看，他们把我们引向另一条路。</p><p>And then a third person directed us sideways.<br>然后第三个人把我们引向一边。</p><p>That was a little confusing.<br>这有点令人困惑。</p><p>Aw, then I saw it.<br>噢，然后我看到了。</p><p>Over the stairs, the sign.<br>在楼梯上，标志。</p><p>It turned out I had written down the Russian word for ‘Exit.’So we headed upstairs and we found a taxi.<br>原来我写下了俄语中的“退出”一词，于是我们上楼，找到了一辆出租车。</p><p>That was great.<br>那太好了。</p><p>And we told the driver, you know, ‘Intourist Hotel,’and then he was willing to take us.<br>我们告诉司机，你知道，’Intourist Hotel’，然后他愿意带我们去。</p><p>And I remember sitting next to the driver, handing him 50 rubles.<br>我记得坐在司机旁边，递给他 50 卢布。</p><p>And he looked at me and he said,(Russian) No, dollar!<br>他看着我说，（俄语）不，美元！</p><p>Fifty dollars?<br>五十美元？</p><p>That was like I don’t know 20 times that amount or something.<br>这就像我不知道 20 倍的数量或其他什么。</p><p>That was not an option for us.<br>这对我们来说不是一个选择。</p><p>So we had to get out of the taxi,and he drove away, leaving us standing there.<br>所以我们不得不下车，他开车走了，留下我们站在那里。</p><p>It was a cold night,and you know everything was strange for us,and we were teenagers,and we were pretty nervous, didn’t know what to do.<br>那是一个寒冷的夜晚，你知道对我们来说一切都很奇怪，我们是十几岁的孩子，我们很紧张，不知道该怎么办。</p><p>Well, we started walking.<br>好吧，我们开始走路。</p><p>We walked to the end of the block.<br>我们走到街区的尽头。</p><p>We turned the corner.<br>我们转过了拐角。</p><p>And 200 yards in front of us, the Intourist Hotel.Well, this experience affected me in two ways.<br>在我们前面200码处，Intourist Hotel.嗯，这次经历在两个方面影响了我。</p><p>The first is that anytime after this trip that I would hear anyone speak Russian,I was just cringe.<br>首先，在这次旅行之后的任何时候，我都会听到有人说俄语，我只是畏缩。</p><p>And the second one is that it taught me the importanceof understanding the local language when you’re traveling.<br>第二个是它教会了我在旅行时了解当地语言的重要性。</p><p>And it actually led to me learning another four languages fluentlyover the following years.<br>在接下来的几年里，它实际上使我流利地学习了另外四种语言。</p><p>Now, before I go on, I’d like to know in the audience -Can we have a little bit of light maybe in the audience?<br>现在，在我继续之前，我想知道观众席上——我们能不能在观众席上有一点光？</p><p>I’d just like to know who’s -By a show of hands, who is not a native English speaker?<br>我只想知道谁是 - 通过举手，谁不是以英语为母语的人？</p><p>It must be 99%.<br>它必须是 99%。</p><p>Anyone who doesn’t speak English, stand up!<br>任何不会说英语的人，请站起来！</p><p>Alright, so I can assumeall of you have, you know, gone through the process of learning a language.<br>好吧，我可以假设你们所有人都经历过学习语言的过程。</p><p>Anybody who speaks three or more languages?<br>有人会说三种或三种以上的语言吗？</p><p>Wow, that’s maybe 70%.<br>哇，大概是70%。</p><p>Four or more languages, anyone?<br>四种或更多语言，有人吗？</p><p>That’s still quite a bit.<br>这还是相当多的。</p><p>Anyone speak five or more languages?<br>有人会说五种或更多语言吗？</p><p>Wow, come see me during the break.<br>哇，休息时间来看我。</p><p>To me, learning a language is…<br>对我来说，学习一门语言是……</p><p>For me, it’s like a deck of playing cards lying faced down on the table.<br>对我来说，这就像一副扑克牌面朝下躺在桌子上。</p><p>As you start learning and understanding, the cards start opening up for you.<br>当你开始学习和理解时，卡片开始为你打开。</p><p>Now there’s no standard way of classifying this.<br>现在没有标准的分类方法。</p><p>But as you learn, you reach certain milestones.<br>但随着你的学习，你会达到某些里程碑。</p><p>And the first one would be when about 25% of the cards are turned up,you reach like a basic level.<br>第一个是当大约 25% 的牌被打开时，你达到了一个基本水平。</p><p>At this level, you have a base vocabulary, some grammar,and you’re able to have maybe very simple conversationsand communicate a little bit.<br>在这个级别上，你有一个基本的词汇，一些语法，你能够进行非常简单的对话和交流。</p><p>And your study goes on until you reach this magical point of fluency,what we call being fluent in the language.<br>你的学习会继续下去，直到你达到这个神奇的流利程度，我们称之为流利的语言。</p><p>Now what does it mean, being fluent in a language?<br>那么，流利地使用一门语言意味着什么？</p><p>It means that you’ve turned up more than 50% of the cards in the deck,and that is the point where you have -where the language becomes part of your subconsciousso that even if you don’t use it anymore for 10 years or longer,you will not forget it.<br>这意味着你已经翻出了牌组中超过50%的牌，这就是你拥有的地方——语言成为你潜意识的一部分，所以即使你不再使用它10年或更长时间，你也不会忘记它。</p><p>You can get back into it within a very, very short time.<br>你可以在非常非常短的时间内重新进入它。</p><p>So this is a level where you’re comfortable thinking in a language,and comfortable communicating in a language.<br>所以在这个层面上，你可以自如地用一种语言思考，也自在地用一种语言进行交流。</p><p>Now, some people go on and, you know, reach like a mastery level.<br>现在，有些人继续前进，你知道，达到了精通的水平。</p><p>By that time, you know classic literature in the other languageand have maybe in-depth knowledge of specialized fields.<br>到那时，您已经了解了另一种语言的经典文学，并且可能对专业领域有深入的了解。</p><p>That’s often the point taken in academia.<br>这是学术界经常采取的观点。</p><p>For me, when I learned my first foreign language,I had a head startbecause I was born to a German-speaking mother and an American father.<br>对我来说，当我学习我的第一门外语时，我有一个良好的开端，因为我的母亲说德语，父亲是美国人。</p><p>Now, when I was a baby, I didn’t really understandthat what my parents were speaking to me were two separate languages.<br>现在，当我还是个婴儿的时候，我真的不明白我的父母对我说的是两种不同的语言。</p><p>But by the time I was two years old, I had figured it all out.<br>但到我两岁的时候，我已经想通了。</p><p>Women speak only German. Men only speak English. Imagine the fun my parents had when they introduced me to couples.<br>女人只会说德语，男人只会说英语，想象一下我父母把我介绍给情侣时的乐趣。</p><p>Being a bilingual was actually pretty helpful in learning my first language.<br>作为一个双语者实际上对学习我的第一语言非常有帮助。</p><p>It definitely helped.<br>这绝对有帮助。</p><p>If you’re -But it also gave me something else.<br>如果你是——但它也给了我别的东西。</p><p>It gave me two identities and the ability to switch between them.<br>它给了我两种身份，并能够在它们之间切换。</p><p>When you’re a native speaker of more than one language,then your personality, your humor, your value system,they change as you switch languages.<br>当你的母语是多种语言的人时，你的个性、你的幽默、你的价值体系，它们都会随着你切换语言而改变。</p><p>This can have huge advantages.<br>这可能具有巨大的优势。</p><p>I mean, some studies have shown an increased problem-solving abilityor even a higher resistance to Alzheimer’s disease.<br>我的意思是，一些研究表明，解决问题的能力有所提高，甚至对阿尔茨海默病的抵抗力更高。</p><p>But what I’m almost interested inis that it’s actually given me a lot of social benefits.<br>但我几乎感兴趣的是，它实际上给了我很多社会效益。</p><p>When you’re a native speaker,then you feel at home among native speakers or in a culture,and also native speakers accept you as one of theirs.<br>当你是母语人士时，你会在母语人士或一种文化中感到宾至如归，而且母语人士也接受你作为他们中的一员。</p><p>Now is this only relevant to native speakers?<br>现在，这是否仅与母语人士有关？</p><p>And that’s the big question.<br>这是个大问题。</p><p>But wouldn’t it be coolif a person learning a foreign language could actually develop another identityand actually enjoy the social benefits of a native speakerthat go beyond communication skills?<br>但是，如果一个学习外语的人实际上可以发展出另一种身份，并真正享受母语人士的社会利益，那不是很酷吗？</p><p>Well, that’s what happened to me.<br>嗯，这就是发生在我身上的事情。</p><p>I was able to do that,and I want to show you from my experience how I think this can be achieved.<br>我能够做到这一点，我想从我的经验中向你展示我认为如何实现这一目标。</p><p>So if we say this green area here is the level of the native speaker,the first thing to note is that on your way to reaching fluency,there is not really any shortcut.<br>因此，如果我们说这里的绿色区域是母语人士的水平，首先要注意的是，在达到流利程度的道路上，实际上没有任何捷径。</p><p>There are some methods that you can use such as the Burrito Principlewhere you identify 20% of the most effective materials to study.<br>您可以使用一些方法，例如墨西哥卷饼原则，您可以确定 20% 的最有效材料进行研究。</p><p>There are some apps, like stuff for time-spaced learning,that increase vocabulary retention.<br>有一些应用程序，比如用于时间间隔学习的东西，可以增加词汇量的保留。</p><p>They save a little time,but in the end, there’s no way around working with the material, practicing it,until you reach the fluency level.<br>他们节省了一点时间，但最终，没有办法使用材料，练习它，直到你达到流利的水平。</p><p>But the second thing to noteis that going from fluency to mastery is a much slower process,and it requires proportionally more effort.<br>但第二件需要注意的事情是，从流利到精通是一个缓慢得多的过程，并且需要成比例地付出更多的努力。</p><p>That’s why most people - they just stop at fluency.<br>这就是为什么大多数人 - 他们只是停留在流利度上。</p><p>They know how to speak English, good enough,and they don’t even attempt to venture on,and I can understand it.<br>他们知道如何说英语，足够好，他们甚至不试图冒险，我能理解。</p><p>But the good news is,to get the benefits of a native speaker, at a native-speaker level,you don’t have to go through mastery in the academic sense.<br>但好消息是，要获得母语人士的好处，在母语人士的水平上，您不必经过学术意义上的精通。</p><p>In fact, you can skip this step altogether.<br>事实上，您可以完全跳过此步骤。</p><p>So if you think about it,there are many native speakers do not have an in-depth knowledgeof specialized fields or sophisticated vocabulary.<br>所以如果你仔细想想，有很多母语人士对专业领域或复杂的词汇没有深入的了解。</p><p>So, that’s not really what is required.<br>所以，这并不是真正需要的。</p><p>So how do you do it?<br>那么你是怎么做到的呢？</p><p>What is required?<br>需要什么？</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Well,I want to give you three areas to focus onwhen you’re learning and interacting with native speakers.<br>好吧，我想给你三个方面，当你学习和与母语人士互动时。</p><p>The first is: work on eliminating your accent.<br>首先是：努力消除你的口音。</p><p>I’m aware I said eliminating.<br>我知道我说过消除。</p><p>It should be at least minimizing it.<br>它至少应该最小化它。</p><p>This is, in my opinion, the most overlooked aspectof language learning today,but it’s also the most important oneto reach what I call a native-speaker level or a speaker-like level.<br>在我看来，这是当今语言学习中最容易被忽视的方面，但也是达到我所说的母语水平或类似说话者水平的最重要的方面。</p><p>If you communicate without an accent or almost without an accent,this changes how natives behave towards you unconsciously,and it also gives you an ability to adapt to a new self-image.<br>如果你没有口音或几乎没有口音地交流，这会无意识地改变当地人对你的行为方式，也让你有能力适应新的自我形象。</p><p>The best way that I’ve found -the best exercise I’ve found to improve your pronunciationis what I call the perfect-sentence technique.<br>我发现的最好的方法 - 我发现的改善发音的最佳练习是我所说的完美句子技巧。</p><p>What you do is you find a native speaker to help you,and you take a book in the foreign language,you open it at a random page,and you read the first sentence.<br>你要做的是找一个母语人士来帮助你，然后你拿一本外语的书，你随便翻开一页，然后读第一句话。</p><p>Then, you ask a native speaker to rate youon obvious accent, slight accent, no accent.<br>然后，你让一个母语人士对你的明显口音、轻微口音、无口音进行评分。</p><p>Then the native speaker will read this sentence back to you.<br>然后母语人士会把这句话读给你听。</p><p>You have to listen carefully and then you repeat.<br>你必须仔细听，然后重复。</p><p>And you repeat this process over and over until the native speaker tells youthat he can no longer hear an accent when you read the sentence.<br>你一遍又一遍地重复这个过程，直到母语人士告诉你，当你读这句话时，他再也听不到口音了。</p><p>Now, I realize it can take a very long timeeven just to get one sentence right.<br>现在，我意识到即使只是把一句话说对，也可能需要很长时间。</p><p>But I promise youif you are persistent, and if you patiently work on this,you’ll be amazed by what happens to your accent.<br>但我向你保证，如果你坚持不懈，如果你耐心地努力，你会惊讶于你的口音会发生什么。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The second area to focus on is using verbs and expressions that locals use.<br>第二个需要关注的领域是使用当地人使用的动词和表达方式。</p><p>Now, we all know the situation that vocabulary can be region-specific.<br>现在，我们都知道词汇可以是特定于区域的情况。</p><p>Like, in the US, you use ‘stand in line.’In the UK, you ‘queue.’That’s all good.<br>比如，在美国，你用的是“排队”，在英国，你是“排队”，这都很好。</p><p>But sometimes, the spoken word is so different,the speech is so different from what you get in textbooks,that the books are almost useless if you want to converse with natives.<br>但有时，口语是如此不同，语音与你在教科书上得到的如此不同，如果你想与当地人交谈，这些书几乎毫无用处。</p><p>I want to give you an example.<br>我想给你举个例子。</p><p>In the French language, there are words like ‘le travail,’which is ‘my work.’A French person talking to his friend would probably say ‘mon boulot,’which is a completely different word.<br>在法语中，有像“le travail”这样的词，这是“我的工作”，一个法国人与他的朋友交谈时可能会说“mon boulot”，这是一个完全不同的词。</p><p>The same for ‘the clothes,’ ‘le vestments,’but you’ll hear ‘le fringues.’Or money is ‘l’argent,’but people say ‘le fric,’ ‘le sou,’ or many other expressions for this.<br>“衣服”、“法衣”也是如此，但你会听到“le fringues”，或者钱是“l’argent”，但人们会说“le fric”、“le sou”或许多其他表达方式。</p><p>So, obviously I’m only scratching the surface here.<br>所以，显然我只是在这里触及了表面。</p><p>But here you actually have to learn all of these words and expressions one by one.<br>但在这里，你实际上必须一个接一个地学习所有这些单词和表达方式。</p><p>And of course, you have to interact with natives to do that.<br>当然，你必须与当地人互动才能做到这一点。</p><p>But after you reach a critical mass that you’re comfortable with,it’ll actually be easier when you encounter something new.<br>但是在你达到一个你觉得舒服的临界质量之后，当你遇到新事物时，它实际上会更容易。</p><p>You’ll just pick it up in one go, like native speakers would,who hear words or expressions that they didn’t know before.<br>你只需一口气拿起它，就像母语人士一样，他们会听到他们以前不知道的单词或表达方式。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The third area to work on is adopting cultural traits.<br>第三个工作领域是采用文化特征。</p><p>What do I mean by that?<br>我这是什么意思？</p><p>So let me ask you:what does this gesture mean to you?<br>那么让我问你：这个姿态对你来说意味着什么？</p><p>Any Italians here?<br>这里有意大利人吗？</p><p>OK, now, depending on what culture you’re from,this could mean something rude,or it could just mean it’s something incredulous,like, ‘Why did you do that?’<br>好吧，现在，根据你来自什么文化，这可能意味着一些粗鲁的事情，或者它可能只是意味着一些难以置信的事情，比如，“你为什么要这样做？</p><p>Or, ‘How could you?’<br>“或者，”你怎么能？</p><p>Or it could just be signaling food, ‘Give me food!’<br>或者它可能只是在向食物发出信号，“给我食物！</p><p>Interesting!<br>有趣！</p><p>In the Middle East,this is just a standard way of signaling ‘Please, wait!’<br>在中东，这只是一种标准的信号方式，“请稍等！</p><p>So these kind of traits you have to internalize,and sometimes, they’re hard to spot,and it takes a lot of active listening.<br>所以这些特质你必须内化，有时，它们很难被发现，这需要大量的积极倾听。</p><p>I want to give you a few more examples.<br>我想再举几个例子。</p><p>So imagine I am with three of my friends: an American, a German, and a Frenchman.And, like, we’re walking and maybe the American bumps his head,and his initial reaction might be, ‘Ouch!’<br>想象一下，我和我的三个朋友在一起：一个美国人，一个德国人，一个法国人。</p><p>That’s how you say it in English.But the German that, you know, gets, I don’t know, elbowed in the crowd,he would say, ‘Ow-ah!’<br>但是，你知道，德国人，我不知道，在人群中肘击，他会说，’噢，啊！</p><p>And the French person might step on the nail and say, ‘Ay!’<br>法国人可能会踩到钉子说，’哎呀！</p><p>So this, of course, in your target language,this is something you have to observe and also internalize,and it has to become part of you.<br>所以，当然，在你的目标语言中，这是你必须观察和内化的东西，它必须成为你的一部分。</p><p>If…<br>如果。。。</p><p>Again I’m with these three friends, and I sit with them,and let’s say I serve them tea,and I ask the American, ‘Would you like a biscuit with your tea?’<br>我又一次和这三个朋友在一起，我和他们坐在一起，假设我给他们端茶，我问美国人，“你想在茶里吃饼干吗？</p><p>And if he answers in the affirmative, he might say, ‘Uh-huh!’<br>如果他的回答是肯定的，他可能会说，“嗯！</p><p>And I can ask the German, ‘Do you know what tea this is?’<br>我可以问德国人，’你知道这是什么茶吗？</p><p>He’ll say, ‘’Mm- hmm!’’<br>他会说，’嗯——嗯！</p><p>And then I ask the Frenchman, ‘Do you like this?’<br>然后我问法国人，’你喜欢这个吗？</p><p>He’ll say, ‘Hmm!’So these difference, they really require active listening.<br>他会说，’嗯！’所以这些差异，它们真的需要积极倾听。</p><p>So all of these three things that I told youwhich is pronunciation,and colloquial speech and adopting cultural traits,they all require that you interact with natives as much as possible.<br>所以我告诉你的这三件事，即发音、口语和采用文化特征，它们都要求你尽可能多地与当地人互动。</p><p>Ideally, you should fully immerse yourself in the culture.<br>理想情况下，您应该完全沉浸在文化中。</p><p>Now if you have the chance to live abroad for a while, that will be great.<br>现在，如果您有机会在国外生活一段时间，那就太好了。</p><p>Or maybe live among natives in your hometown.<br>或者也许住在你家乡的当地人中间。</p><p>Perhaps just have a romantic relationship,or even just spend time, you know, with co-workers.<br>也许只是有一段浪漫的关系，甚至只是花时间，你知道，和同事在一起。</p><p>So, romantic relationships, I could do a whole talk about that.<br>所以，恋爱关系，我可以做一个完整的讨论。</p><p>That works really well for these things.<br>这对于这些事情非常有效。</p><p>But yeah -So this will be different for everybody, of course.<br>但是，是的 - 所以当然，这对每个人来说都是不同的。</p><p>But even when you’re not around natives, your learning must not stop.<br>但即使你不在当地人身边，你的学习也不能停止。</p><p>Because what you can do is you can watch TV shows and films,you can mimic the characters,you can write down anything that you haven’t heard of before,and practice that.<br>因为你能做的就是看电视节目和电影，你可以模仿角色，你可以写下任何你以前没有听说过的东西，然后练习。</p><p>I also want to encourage you to learn the lyrics of songs.<br>我还想鼓励你学习歌曲的歌词。</p><p>Songs are really great because they tell stories.<br>歌曲真的很棒，因为它们会讲故事。</p><p>And they not only help your pronunciation when you sing them,but if they’re emotional,they can anchor these expressions into your active vocabulary.<br>当你唱歌时，它们不仅有助于你的发音，而且如果他们是情绪化的，它们可以将这些表达锚定到你的活跃词汇中。</p><p>And it’s like speaking all day and really using the expressions unconsciously.<br>这就像整天说话，真的在不知不觉中使用这些表达方式。</p><p>It’s a great way.<br>这是一个很好的方法。</p><p>So music, definitely.<br>所以音乐，绝对是。</p><p>The other thing you need to move towards native-speaker statusis the right mindset,and a belief that if you sound like a native,express yourself like a native,talk like a native and act like a native,you’ll actually achieve a native-like level.<br>迈向母语人士地位的另一件事是正确的心态，以及一种信念，即如果你听起来像母语，像母语一样表达自己，像母语一样说话，像母语一样行事，你实际上会达到类似母语的水平。</p><p>So if I could only leave you with one thing today,it would be: work on your pronunciation.<br>因此，如果我今天只能留给你一件事，那就是：努力提高你的发音。</p><p>Because pronunciationhelps any stage of the learning process,even in the very beginning.<br>因为发音有助于学习过程的任何阶段，即使是在一开始。</p><p>It’ll speed up everything.<br>它会加快一切。</p><p>And it also is the key to reaching a native-speaker level,or almost-native-speaker status.<br>这也是达到母语水平或几乎母语水平的关键。</p><p>So before I go,I’d like to tell you how I was able to overcome my fear of the Russian language.<br>所以在我走之前，我想告诉你我是如何克服对俄语的恐惧的。</p><p>It was a very, very elegant solution.<br>这是一个非常非常优雅的解决方案。</p><p>I married a Russian girl.<br>我娶了一个俄罗斯女孩。</p><p>And I now have little kids in my home that speak Russian to me every day.<br>我现在家里有小孩，他们每天都对我说俄语。</p><p>So I want to thank you.<br>所以我要感谢你。</p><p>(Applause)<br>（掌声）</p><p>And before I go, I just want to

However, it is also common to hear these structures with <em>was</em>, especially in the <em>he</em>&#x2F;<em>she</em> form.当 if 后面接动词 be 时，说 if I were、if he were、if she were 和 if it was 在语法上是正确的。然而，这些结构与 was 一起听到也很常见，尤其是在 he&#x2F;she 形式中。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>If</strong> I were you, I wouldn’t mention it.</em>  如果我是你，我就不会提这件事。</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Conditionals-1-2"><a href="#Conditionals-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Conditionals 1: 2"></a>Conditionals 1: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct option to complete the sentences.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>What would you do differently if you _____ to do this again?<br>have<br>had<br>would have</li><li>If I _____ the more expensive bike, I won’t have enough money to pay my rent.<br>buy<br>bought<br>will buy</li><li>The project _____ delayed if I don’t finish this report on time.<br>is<br>will be<br>would be</li><li>If I _____ you, I’d go to the doctor’s.<br>am<br>were<br>will be</li><li>When I look at a computer screen for too long, I _____ a headache.<br>get<br>got<br>would get</li><li>You don’t need to print your ticket as long as _____ the email.<br>you have<br>you had<br>you’ll have</li><li>If I cared what people think, I _____ a very boring life!<br>had<br>will have<br>would have</li><li>I’ll go and visit her as soon as I _____ time.<br>have<br>will have<br>had</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>What would you do differently if you _____ to do this again?<br>have<br>✔had<br>would have</li><li>If I _____ the more expensive bike, I won’t have enough money to pay my rent.<br>✔buy<br>bought<br>will buy</li><li>The project _____ delayed if I don’t finish this report on time.<br>is<br>✔will be<br>would be</li><li>If I _____ you, I’d go to the doctor’s.<br>am<br>✔were<br>will be</li><li>When I look at a computer screen for too long, I _____ a headache.<br>✔get<br>got<br>would get</li><li>You don’t need to print your ticket as long as _____ the email.<br>✔you have<br>you had<br>you’ll have</li><li>If I cared what people think, I _____ a very boring life!<br>had<br>will have<br>✔would have</li><li>I’ll go and visit her as soon as I _____ time.<br>✔have<br>will have<br>had</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

They are formed using present participles (<em>going</em>, <em>reading</em>, <em>seeing</em>, <em>walking</em>, etc.), past participles (<em>gone</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>seen</em>, <em>walked</em>, etc.) or perfect participles (<em>having gone</em>, <em>having read</em>, <em>having seen</em>, <em>having walked</em>, etc.). 分词从句使我们能够以更经济的方式表达信息。它们由现在分词（going、reading、seeing、walking 等）、过去分词（gone、read、seeing、walking 等）或完成分词（having gone、having read、having see、having walk 等构成） .)。</p><p>We can use participle clauses when the participle and the verb in the main clause have the same subject. For example,当分词和主句中的动词具有相同的主语时，我们可以使用分词从句。例如，</p><blockquote><p><em>Waiting for Ellie, I made some tea.</em> (<em>While <strong>I</strong> was waiting for Ellie, <strong>I</strong> made some tea.</em>)  我泡了茶等待艾莉。 （在等艾莉的时候，我泡了一些茶。）</p></blockquote><p>Participle clauses do not have a specific tense. The tense is indicated by the verb in the main clause. 分词从句没有特定的时态。时态由主句中的动词表示。</p><p>Participle clauses are mainly used in written texts, particularly in a literary, academic or journalistic style. 分词从句主要用于书面文本，特别是文学、学术或新闻风格。</p><h4 id="Present-participle-clauses-现在分词从句"><a href="#Present-participle-clauses-现在分词从句" class="headerlink" title="Present participle clauses-现在分词从句"></a>Present participle clauses-现在分词从句</h4><p>Here are some common ways we use present participle clauses. Note that present participles have a similar meaning to active verbs. 以下是我们使用现在分词从句的一些常见方法。请注意，现在分词与主动动词具有相似的含义。</p><blockquote><ul><li>To give the result of an action给出动作的结果<br><em>The bomb exploded, <strong>destroying the building</strong>.炸弹爆炸，摧毁了建筑物。</em></li><li>To give the reason for an action给出采取行动的理由<br><em><strong>Knowing she loved reading</strong>, Richard bought her a book.理查德知道她喜欢读书，就给她买了一本书。</em></li><li>To talk about an action that happened at the same time as another action谈论与另一个动作同时发生的动作<br><em><strong>Standing in the queue</strong>, I realised I didn’t have any money.站在队列里，我发现自己没有钱。</em></li><li>To add information about the subject of the main clause添加有关主句主语的信息<br><em><strong>Starting in the new year</strong>, the new policy bans cars in the city centre.从新年开始，新政策禁止汽车在市中心行驶。</em></li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="Past-participle-clauses-过去分词从句"><a href="#Past-participle-clauses-过去分词从句" class="headerlink" title="Past participle clauses-过去分词从句"></a>Past participle clauses-过去分词从句</h4><p>Here are some common ways that we use past participle clauses. Note that past participles normally have a passive meaning.以下是我们使用过去分词从句的一些常见方法。请注意，过去分词通常具有被动含义。</p><ul><li>With a similar meaning to an <em>if</em> condition与 if 条件的含义类似<br><em><strong>Used in this way</strong>, participles can make your writing more concise.这样使用分词可以使你的写作更加简洁。</em>(<em>If you use participles in this way, …</em> )（如果您以这种方式使用分词，…）</li><li>To give the reason for an action给出采取行动的理由<br><em><strong>Worried by the news</strong>, she called the hospital.听到这个消息，她很担心，于是给医院打电话。</em></li><li>To add information about the subject of the main clause添加有关主句主语的信息<br><em><strong>Filled with pride</strong>, he walked towards the stage.他满怀自豪地走向讲台。</em></li></ul><h4 id="Perfect-participle-clauses-完成分词从句"><a href="#Perfect-participle-clauses-完成分词从句" class="headerlink" title="Perfect participle clauses-完成分词从句"></a>Perfect participle clauses-完成分词从句</h4><p>Perfect participle clauses show that the action they describe was finished before the action in the main clause. Perfect participles can be structured to make an active or passive meaning.完美分词从句表明它们所描述的动作是在主句中的动作之前完成的。完美分词可以构成主动或被动的含义。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Having got dressed</strong>, he slowly went downstairs.穿好衣服，他缓缓下了楼。<br><strong>Having finished their training完成训练后</strong>, they will be fully qualified doctors.，他们将是完全合格的医生。<br><strong>Having been made redundant已被裁员</strong>, she started looking for a new job.，她开始寻找新工作。</em></p></blockquote><h4 id="Participle-clauses-after-conjunctions-and-prepositions-连词和介词后的分词从句"><a href="#Participle-clauses-after-conjunctions-and-prepositions-连词和介词后的分词从句" class="headerlink" title="Participle clauses after conjunctions and prepositions-连词和介词后的分词从句"></a>Participle clauses after conjunctions and prepositions-连词和介词后的分词从句</h4><p>It is also common for participle clauses, especially with <em>-ing</em>, to follow conjunctions and prepositions such as <em>before</em>, <em>after</em>, <em>instead of</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>since</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>while</em> and <em>in spite of</em>.分词从句（尤其是 -ing）跟在连词和介词后面也很常见，例如 before、after、rather of、on、since、when、while 和 inthough of。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Before cooking</strong>, you should wash your hands. 做饭前，应该洗手。<br><strong>Instead of complaining about it而不是抱怨它</strong>, they should try doing something positive.，他们应该尝试做一些积极的事情。<br><strong>On arriving at the hotel抵达酒店后</strong>, he went to get changed.，他去换衣服了。<br><strong>While packing her things收拾东西的时候</strong>, she thought about the last two years.，她想起了这两年的事情。<br><strong>In spite of having read the instructions twice尽管已经阅读了两次说明</strong>, I still couldn’t understand how to use it.，我还是没明白怎么用。</em></p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1"><a href="#Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2"></a>Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct words.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

To do this, we can use direct speech or indirect speech.报道性言论是指我们告诉某人另一个人所说的话。为此，我们可以使用直接引语或间接引语。</p><blockquote><p>direct speech: <em>‘I work in a bank,’ said Daniel.</em>  直接引语：“我在银行工作，”丹尼尔说。<br>indirect speech: <em>Daniel said that he worked in a bank.</em>  间接引语：丹尼尔说他在银行工作。</p></blockquote><p>In indirect speech, we often use a tense which is ‘further back’ in the past (e.g. <em>worked</em>) than the tense originally used (e.g. <em>work</em>). This is called ‘backshift’. We also may need to change other words that were used, for example pronouns.在间接引语中，我们经常使用比最初使用的时态（例如工作）“更早”的过去时态（例如工作）。这称为“后移”。我们可能还需要更改使用的其他单词，例如代词。</p><h4 id="Present-simple-present-continuous-and-present-perfect-一般现在时、现在进行时和现在完成时"><a href="#Present-simple-present-continuous-and-present-perfect-一般现在时、现在进行时和现在完成时" class="headerlink" title="Present simple, present continuous and present perfect-一般现在时、现在进行时和现在完成时"></a>Present simple, present continuous and present perfect-一般现在时、现在进行时和现在完成时</h4><p>When we backshift, present simple changes to past simple, present continuous changes to past continuous and present perfect changes to past perfect.当我们后移时，将简单变化呈现为简单过去时，将连续变化呈现为过去进行时，将完美变化呈现为过去完成时。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘I travel a lot in my job.’</em>  “我因工作需要经常出差。”</p><ul><li><em>Jamila said that she travelled a lot in her job.</em>  贾米拉说，她在工作中经常出差。</li></ul><p><em>‘The baby’s sleeping!’</em>  “宝宝正在睡觉！”</p><ul><li><em>He told me the baby was sleeping.</em>  他告诉我孩子正在睡觉。*</li></ul><p><em>‘I’ve hurt my leg.’</em>  “我的腿受伤了。”</p><ul><li><em>She said she’d hurt her leg.</em>  她说她的腿受伤了。</li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="Past-simple-and-past-continuous-一般过去时和过去进行时"><a href="#Past-simple-and-past-continuous-一般过去时和过去进行时" class="headerlink" title="Past simple and past continuous-一般过去时和过去进行时"></a>Past simple and past continuous-一般过去时和过去进行时</h4><p>When we backshift, past simple usually changes to past perfect simple, and past continuous usually changes to past perfect continuous.当我们后移时，简单过去时通常会变为简单过去完成时，过去进行时通常会变为过去完成进行时。</p><blockquote><p>‘We lived in China for five years.’  “我们在中国生活了五年。”</p><ul><li><em>She told me they’d lived in China for five years.</em>  她告诉我他们在中国生活了五年。</li></ul><p>-‘It was raining all day.’*  “一整天都在下雨。”</p><ul><li><em>He told me it had been raining all day.</em>  他告诉我一整天都在下雨。</li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="Past-perfect-过去完成时"><a href="#Past-perfect-过去完成时" class="headerlink" title="Past perfect-过去完成时"></a>Past perfect-过去完成时</h4><p>The past perfect doesn’t change.过去完成时不会改变。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘I’d tried everything without success, but this new medicine is great.’</em>  “我尝试了一切都没有成功，但这种新药很棒。”</p><ul><li><em>He said he’d tried everything without success, but the new medicine was great.</em>  他说他尝试了一切都没有成功，但新药很棒。</li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="No-backshift-无后移"><a href="#No-backshift-无后移" class="headerlink" title="No backshift-无后移"></a>No backshift-无后移</h4><p>If what the speaker has said is still true or relevant, it’s not always necessary to change the tense. This might happen when the speaker has used a present tense.如果说话者所说的话仍然正确或相关，则并不总是需要改变时态。当说话者使用现在时时可能会发生这种情况。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘I go to the gym next to your house.’</em>  “我去你家旁边的健身房。”</p><ul><li><em>Jenny told me that she goes to the gym next to my house. I’m thinking about going with her.</em>  珍妮告诉我她去我家旁边的健身房。我正在考虑和她一起去。</li></ul><p><em>‘I’m working in Italy for the next six months.’</em>  “接下来的六个月我将在意大利工作。”</p><ul><li><em>He told me he’s working in Italy for the next six months.

[It is not the same day any more.]</em>  她告诉我她计划那天就这么做。 【这已经不是同一天了。】</li></ul></blockquote><p>In the same way, <em>these</em> changes to <em>those</em>, <em>now</em> changes to <em>then</em>, <em>yesterday</em> changes to <em>the day before</em>, <em>tomorrow</em> changes to <em>the next&#x2F;following day</em> and <em>ago</em> changes to <em>before</em>.同样，这些更改为那些，现在更改为那时，昨天更改为前天，明天更改为下一天&#x2F;后天，前更改为之前。</p><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1"><a href="#Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2"></a>Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct words.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

I’ll have the risotto, please.’</em>  “让我们来看看。请给我一份意大利调味饭。”</p><ul><li><em>He decided <strong>to have</strong> the risotto.</em>  他决定吃意大利调味饭。</li></ul><p><em>‘I’ll do the report by Friday, for sure.’</em>  “我肯定会在周五之前完成报告。”</p><ul><li><em>She promised <strong>to do</strong> the report by Friday.</em>  她承诺在周五之前完成报告。</li></ul><p><em>‘It’s not a good idea to write your passwords down.’</em>  “写下密码不是一个好主意。”</p><ul><li><em>They advised us <strong>not to write</strong> our passwords down.</em>  他们建议我们不要写下密码。</li></ul></blockquote><p>We can also use an infinitive to report imperatives, with a reporting verb like <em>tell</em>, <em>order</em>, <em>instruct</em>, <em>direct</em> or <em>warn</em>.我们还可以使用不定式来报告祈使语气，并使用报告动词，如告诉、命令、指示、直接或警告。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘Please wait for me in reception.’</em>  “请在接待处等我。”</p><ul><li><em>The guide told us <strong>to wait</strong> for her in reception.</em>  导游让我们在接待处等她。</li></ul><p><em>‘Don’t go in there!’</em>  “别进去！”</p><ul><li><em>The police officer warned us <strong>not to go</strong> in there.</em>  警察警告我们不要进去。</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="Reporting-verb-ing-form-报告动词-ing形式"><a href="#Reporting-verb-ing-form-报告动词-ing形式" class="headerlink" title="Reporting verb + -ing form  报告动词+-ing形式"></a><em>Reporting verb + -ing form</em>  报告动词+-ing形式</h3><p>Verbs like <em>admit</em>, <em>apologise for</em>, <em>complain about</em>, <em>deny</em>, <em>insist on</em>, <em>mention</em> and <em>suggest</em> can follow an <em>-ing</em> form pattern.像承认、道歉、抱怨、否认、坚持、提及和建议这样的动词可以遵循 -ing 形式模式。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘I broke the window.’</em>  “我打破了窗户。”</p><ul><li><em>She admitted  <strong>breaking</strong> the window.</em>  她承认打破了窗户。</li></ul><p><em>‘I’m really sorry I didn’t get back to you sooner.’</em>  “我真的很抱歉没有早点回复你。”</p><ul><li><em>He apologised for <strong>not getting</strong> back to me sooner.</em>  他为没有早点回复我而道歉。</li></ul><p><em>‘Let’s take a break.’</em>  “休息一下吧。”</p><ul><li><em>She suggested <strong>taking</strong> a break.</em>  她建议休息一下。</li></ul></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1"><a href="#Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2"></a>Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct words.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

To do this, we can use direct speech or indirect speech.报告问题是当我们告诉某人另一个人问的问题时。为此，我们可以使用直接引语或间接引语。</p><blockquote><p>direct speech: <em>‘Do you like working in sales?’ he asked.</em>  直接引语：“你喜欢销售工作吗？”他问。<br>indirect speech: <em>He asked me if I liked working in sales.</em>  间接引语：他问我是否喜欢从事销售工作。</p></blockquote><p>In indirect speech, we change the question structure (e.g. <em>Do you like</em>) to a statement structure (e.g. <em>I like</em>).在间接引语中，我们将问题结构（例如，你喜欢吗）更改为陈述结构（例如，我喜欢）。</p><p>We also often make changes to the tenses and other words in the same way as for reported statements (e.g. <em>have done</em> → <em>had done</em>, <em>today</em> → <em>that day</em>). You can learn about these changes on the <a href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/node/1082">Reported speech 1 – statements</a> page.我们还经常以与报道性陈述相同的方式改变时态和其他词语（例如，已经做了→已经做了，今天→那天）。您可以在报告演讲 1 – 声明页面了解这些变化。</p><h4 id="Yes-no-questions是-否问题"><a href="#Yes-no-questions是-否问题" class="headerlink" title="Yes&#x2F;no questions是&#x2F;否问题"></a><em>Yes</em>&#x2F;<em>no</em> questions是&#x2F;否问题</h4><p>In <em>yes</em>&#x2F;<em>no</em> questions, we use <em>if</em> or <em>whether</em> to report the question. <em>If</em> is more common.在是&#x2F;否问题中，我们使用是否或是否报告问题。如果是比较常见的。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘Are you going to the Helsinki conference?’</em>  “你要去赫尔辛基会议吗？”</p><ul><li><em>He asked me if I was going to the Helsinki conference.</em>  他问我是否要去参加赫尔辛基会议。</li></ul><p><em>‘Have you finished the project yet?’</em>  “你完成这个项目了吗？”</p><ul><li><em>She asked us whether we’d finished the project yet.</em>  她问我们这个项目是否完成了。</li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="Questions-with-a-question-word-带有疑问词的疑问句"><a href="#Questions-with-a-question-word-带有疑问词的疑问句" class="headerlink" title="Questions with a question word-带有疑问词的疑问句"></a>Questions with a question word-带有疑问词的疑问句</h4><p>In <em>what</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>why</em>, <em>who</em>, <em>when</em> or <em>how</em> questions, we use the question word to report the question.在什么、哪里、为什么、谁、何时或如何的问题中，我们使用疑问词来报告问题。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘What time does the train leave?’</em>  “火车什么时候离开？”</p><ul><li><em>He asked me what time the train left.</em>  他问我火车几点出发。</li></ul><p><em>‘Where did he go?’</em>  “他去哪了？”</p><ul><li><em>She asked where he went.</em>  她问他去哪儿了。</li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="Reporting-verbs-报告动词"><a href="#Reporting-verbs-报告动词" class="headerlink" title="Reporting verbs-报告动词"></a>Reporting verbs-报告动词</h4><p>The most common reporting verb for questions is <em>ask</em>, but we can also use verbs like <em>enquire</em>, <em>want to know</em> or <em>wonder</em>.最常见的表达问题的动词是“询问”，但我们也可以使用“询问”、“想知道”或“想知道”等动词。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘Did you bring your passports?’</em>  “你带护照了吗？”</p><ul><li><em>She wanted to know if they’d brought their passports.</em>  她想知道他们是否带了护照。</li></ul><p><em>‘When could you get this done by?’</em>  “你什么时候能完成这件事？”</p><ul><li><em>He wondered when we could get it done by.</em>  他想知道我们什么时候能完成这件事。</li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="Offers-requests-and-suggestions-报价、请求和建议"><a href="#Offers-requests-and-suggestions-报价、请求和建议" class="headerlink" title="Offers, requests and suggestions-报价、请求和建议"></a>Offers, requests and suggestions-报价、请求和建议</h4><p>If the question is making an offer, request or suggestion, we can use a specific verb pattern instead, for example <em>offer</em> + infinitive, <em>ask</em> + infinitive or <em>suggest</em> + ing.如果问题是提出要约、请求或建议，我们可以使用特定的动词模式，例如 Offer + 不定式、ask + 不定式或 suggest + ing。</p><blockquote><p><em>‘Would you like me to help you?’</em>  “你想要我帮助你吗？”</p><ul><li><em>He offered to help me.</em>  他主动提出要帮助我。</li></ul><p>‘<em>Can you hold this for me, please?</em>‘  “你能帮我拿着这个吗？”</p><ul><li><em>She asked me to hold it.</em>  她让我拿着它。</li></ul><p><em>‘Why don’t we check with Joel?’</em>  “我们为什么不问问乔尔呢？”</p><ul><li><em>She suggested checking with Joel.</em> 她建议与乔尔核实。</li></ul></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1"><a href="#Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2"></a>Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct words.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

id="Grammar-explanation-语法解释"><a href="#Grammar-explanation-语法解释" class="headerlink" title="Grammar explanation-语法解释"></a>Grammar explanation-语法解释</h3><p>Relative clauses give us information about the person or thing mentioned.  关系从句为我们提供有关所提到的人或事物的信息。</p><p>Non-defining relative clauses give us <em>extra</em> information about someone or something. It isn’t essential for understanding who or what we are talking about.  非限定关系从句为我们提供有关某人或某事的额外信息。这对于理解我们在谈论谁或谈论什么并不重要。</p><blockquote><p><em>My grandfather</em><em>,</em>* <strong>who’s 87,</strong> goes swimming every day.*  我 87 岁的祖父每天都去游泳。<br><em>The house</em><em>, which was built in 1883,</em>* has just been opened to the public.*  这所房子建于1883年，刚刚向公众开放。<br><em>The award was given to Sara</em><em>, whose short story impressed the judges</em><em>.</em>   该奖项授予萨拉，她的短篇小说给评委留下了深刻的印象。</p></blockquote><p>We always use a relative pronoun or adverb to start a non-defining relative clause: <em><strong>who</strong></em>, <em><strong>which</strong></em>, <em><strong>whose</strong></em>, <em><strong>when</strong></em> or <em><strong>where</strong></em> (but not <em>that</em>). We also use commas to separate the clause from the rest of the sentence.  我们总是使用关系代词或副词来启动非限定性关系从句：who、which、whose、when 或 where（但不是 that）。我们还使用逗号将子句与句子的其余部分分隔开。</p><h4 id="who-which-and-whose-谁，哪个和谁的"><a href="#who-which-and-whose-谁，哪个和谁的" class="headerlink" title="who, which and whose-谁，哪个和谁的"></a><em>who</em>, <em>which</em> and <em>whose</em>-谁，哪个和谁的</h4><p>We can use <em><strong>who</strong></em> to talk about people, <em><strong>which</strong></em> to talk about things and <em><strong>whose</strong></em> to refer to the person or thing that something belongs to.  我们可以使用 who 来谈论人，which 来谈论事物，以及 who 来指代某事物所属的人或事物。</p><blockquote><p><em>Yesterday I met my new boss, <strong>who</strong> was very nice.</em>  昨天我见到了我的新老板，他非常友善。<br><em>The house, <strong>which</strong> is very big, is also very cold!</em>  房子很大，也很冷！<br><em>My next-door neighbour, <strong>whose</strong> children go to school with ours, has just bought a new car.</em>  我的隔壁邻居刚刚买了一辆新车，他的孩子和我们的孩子一起上学。<br><em>After the port there is a row of fishermen’s houses, <strong>whose</strong> lights can be seen from across the bay.</em>  港口后面有一排渔民的房屋，从海湾对面就能看到渔民的灯光。</p></blockquote><h4 id="Places-and-times-地点和时间"><a href="#Places-and-times-地点和时间" class="headerlink" title="Places and times-地点和时间"></a>Places and times-地点和时间</h4><p>We can use <em><strong>which</strong></em> with a preposition to talk about places and times. In these cases it’s more common to use <em><strong>where</strong></em> or <em><strong>when</strong></em> instead of <em>which</em> and the preposition.  我们可以将<strong>which与介词一起使用</strong>来谈论地点和时间。在这些情况下，更常见的是使用where或when而不是which和介词。</p><blockquote><p><em>City Park, <strong>which</strong> we used to go <strong>to</strong>, has been closed down.</em>  我们以前常去的城市公园已经关闭了。<br><em>City Park, <strong>where</strong> we used to go, has been closed down.</em>  我们以前常去的城市公园已经关闭了。<br><em>December, <strong>which</strong> Christmas is celebrated <strong>in</strong>, is a summer month for the southern hemisphere.</em>  庆祝圣诞节的十二月是南半球的夏季月份。<br><em>December, <strong>when</strong> Christmas is celebrated, is a summer month for the southern hemisphere.</em>  十二月是南半球的夏季月份，庆祝圣诞节。</p></blockquote><p>However, when we use <em>which</em> <strong>without a preposition</strong>, we can’t use <em>where</em> or <em>when</em>.  然而，当我们使用没有介词的which时，我们不能使用where或when。</p><blockquote><p><em>Centre Park, <strong>which</strong> we love, is always really busy on Saturdays.</em>  我们喜爱的中心公园在周六总是非常繁忙。<br><em>February, <strong>which</strong> is my favourite month, lasts 29 days this year.</em>  二月是我最喜欢的月份，今年有 29 天。*</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again. 做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3

id="Grammar-explanation-语法解释"><a href="#Grammar-explanation-语法解释" class="headerlink" title="Grammar explanation-语法解释"></a>Grammar explanation-语法解释</h3><p>Relative clauses give us information about the person or thing mentioned.   关系从句为我们提供有关所提到的人或事物的信息。</p><p>Defining relative clauses give us <em>essential</em> information – information that tells us who or what we are talking about.  定义关系从句为我们提供了基本信息——告诉我们正在谈论的人或事的信息。</p><blockquote><p><em>The woman <strong>who lives next door</strong> works in a bank.</em>  住在隔壁的那位女士在银行工作。<br><em>These are the flights <strong>that have been cancelled</strong>.</em>  这些是已取消的航班。</p></blockquote><p>We usually use a relative pronoun or adverb to start a defining relative clause: <em><strong>who</strong></em>, <em><strong>which</strong></em>, <em><strong>that</strong></em>, <em><strong>when</strong></em>, <em><strong>where</strong></em> or <em><strong>whose</strong></em>.  我们通常使用关系代词或副词来开始定义关系从句：who、which、that、when、where 或 who。</p><h4 id="who-that"><a href="#who-that" class="headerlink" title="who&#x2F;that"></a><em>who</em>&#x2F;<em>that</em></h4><p>We can use <em><strong>who</strong></em> or <em><strong>that</strong></em> to talk about people. <em>that</em> is more common and a bit more informal.  我们可以用 who 或 that 来谈论人。<strong>that</strong> 更常见，也更非正式。</p><blockquote><p><em>She’s the woman <strong>who</strong> cuts my hair.</em>  她就是那个给我剪头发的女人。<br><em>He’s the man <strong>that</strong> I met at the conference.</em>  他就是我在会议上认识的那个人。</p></blockquote><h4 id="which-that"><a href="#which-that" class="headerlink" title="which&#x2F;that"></a><em>which</em>&#x2F;<em>that</em></h4><p>We can use <em><strong>which</strong></em> or <em><strong>that</strong></em> to talk about things. <em><strong>that</strong></em> is more common and a bit more informal.  我们可以用which或that来谈论事物。<strong>that</strong> 更常见，也更非正式。</p><blockquote><p><em>There was a one-year guarantee <strong>which</strong> came with the TV.</em>  电视附带一年保修。<br><em>The laptop <strong>that</strong> I bought last week has started making a strange noise!</em>  我上周买的笔记本电脑开始发出奇怪的声音！</p></blockquote><h4 id="Other-pronouns-其他代词"><a href="#Other-pronouns-其他代词" class="headerlink" title="Other pronouns-其他代词"></a>Other pronouns-其他代词</h4><p><em>when</em> can refer to a time.  when 可以指时间。</p><blockquote><p><em>Summer is the season <strong>when</strong> I’m happiest.</em>  夏天是我最快乐的季节。</p></blockquote><p><em>where</em> can refer to a place.  where 可以指一个地方。</p><blockquote><p><em>That’s the stadium <strong>where</strong> Real Madrid play.</em>  那是皇家马德里队比赛的体育场。</p></blockquote><p><em>whose</em> refers to the person that something belongs to.  whose 指某物所属的人。</p><blockquote><p><em>He’s a musician <strong>whose</strong> albums have sold millions.</em>  他是一位专辑销量数百万张的音乐家。</p></blockquote><h4 id="Omitting-the-relative-pronoun-省略关系代词"><a href="#Omitting-the-relative-pronoun-省略关系代词" class="headerlink" title="Omitting the relative pronoun-省略关系代词"></a>Omitting the relative pronoun-省略关系代词</h4><p>Sometimes we can leave out the relative pronoun. For example, we can usually leave out <em>who</em>, <em>which</em> or <em>that</em> if it is followed by a subject.  有时我们可以省略关系代词。例如，如果后面跟主语，我们通常可以省略 who、which 或 that。</p><blockquote><p><em>The assistant [that] <strong>we</strong> met was really kind.</em>  我们遇到的助理非常友善。<br>  (<em>we</em> &#x3D; subject, can omit <em>that</em>)（我们 &#x3D; 主语，可以省略）</p></blockquote><p>We can’t usually leave it out if it is followed by a verb.  如果后面跟动词，我们通常不能省略它。</p><blockquote><p><em>The assistant that <strong>helped</strong> us was really kind.</em>  帮助我们的助理真的很友善。<br>  (<em>helped</em> &#x3D; verb, can’t omit <em>that</em>)（帮助&#x3D;动词，不能省略）</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink"

They refer back to a person or thing.反身代词是像我自己、你自己、他自己、她自己、它自己、我们自己、你们自己和他们自己这样的词。他们指的是一个人或一件事。</p><p>We often use reflexive pronouns when the subject and the object of a verb are the same. 当动词的主语和宾语相同时，我们经常使用反身代词。</p><blockquote><p><em>I cut <strong>myself</strong> when <strong>I</strong> was making dinner last night.</em>  昨晚做晚饭时我割伤了自己。<br><em>I hope <strong>you</strong> enjoy <strong>yourselves</strong> at the party tonight!</em>  我希望你们在今晚的聚会上玩得开心！<br><em>My phone isn’t working properly. <strong>It</strong> turns <strong>itself</strong> off for no reason.</em>  我的手机无法正常工作。它无缘无故地自行关闭。<br><em><strong>We</strong> need to believe in <strong>ourselves</strong> more.</em>  我们需要更加相信自己。</p></blockquote><h4 id="Adding-emphasis-增加强调"><a href="#Adding-emphasis-增加强调" class="headerlink" title="Adding emphasis-增加强调"></a>Adding emphasis-增加强调</h4><p>We can add a reflexive pronoun for emphasis when it’s unusual or different.  当不寻常或不同时，我们可以添加一个反身代词来强调。</p><blockquote><p><em>He wants to pass his driving test so that <strong>he</strong> can drive <strong>himself</strong> to work.</em>  他想通过驾驶考试，这样他就可以自己开车去上班。<br><em>She broke her arm, so <strong>she</strong> couldn’t wash <strong>herself</strong> very easily.</em>  她摔断了手臂，所以她不能轻易地洗澡。</p></blockquote><p>We can use reflexive pronouns to emphasise that someone does it personally, not anybody else.  我们可以使用反身代词来强调是某人亲自做的，而不是其他人做的。</p><blockquote><p><em>The door was definitely locked. <strong>I</strong> locked it <strong>myself</strong>.</em>  门肯定是锁着的。我自己锁的。<br><em>Are <strong>you</strong> redecorating your flat <strong>yourselves</strong>?</em>  你自己重新装修你的公寓吗？</p></blockquote><p>We can also use a reflexive pronoun together with the noun it refers to in order to emphasise it.  我们还可以将反身代词与其所指的名词一起使用以强调它。</p><blockquote><p><em>We talked to the <strong>manager herself</strong>, and she agreed to give us our money back.</em>  我们亲自与经理交谈，她同意退还我们的钱。<br><em><strong>Parents themselves</strong> need to take more responsibility for their children’s learning.</em>  家长本身需要对孩子的学习承担更多的责任。</p></blockquote><h4 id="By-reflexive-pronoun-By-反身代词"><a href="#By-reflexive-pronoun-By-反身代词" class="headerlink" title="By + reflexive pronoun-By + 反身代词"></a><em>By</em> + reflexive pronoun-By + 反身代词</h4><p>We can use <em>by</em> + reflexive pronoun to mean <em>alone</em>.我们可以使用 by + 反身代词来表示单独的意思。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>He</strong> usually goes on holiday <strong>by himself</strong>.</em>  他通常一个人去度假。<br><em>Do <strong>you</strong> enjoy being <strong>by yourself</strong>?</em>  你喜欢独处吗？</p></blockquote><h4 id="Reciprocal-pronouns-交互代词"><a href="#Reciprocal-pronouns-交互代词" class="headerlink" title="Reciprocal pronouns-交互代词"></a>Reciprocal pronouns-交互代词</h4><p>Notice the difference between plural reflexive pronouns and reciprocal pronouns (<em>each other</em>, <em>one another</em>).  注意复数反身代词和互惠代词（彼此，彼此）之间的区别。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>They</strong>‘re buying <strong>themselves</strong> a new television.</em>  他们正在给自己买一台新电视。<br><em><strong>They</strong>‘re buying <strong>each other</strong> small gifts.</em>  他们互相买小礼物。<br><em><strong>We</strong> looked at <strong>ourselves</strong> in the mirror.</em>  我们看着镜子里的自己。<br><em><strong>We</strong> looked at <strong>each other</strong> in surprise.</em>  我们惊讶地看着对方。</p></blockquote><p>With reciprocal pronouns (e.g. <em>each other</em>), each person does the action to the other person&#x2F;people but not to themselves. 使用互惠代词（例如“彼此”）时，每个人都会对其他人执行该操作，但不会对其自己执行该操作。</p><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1"><a href="#Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2"></a>Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct words.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

Question tags are more common in speaking than writing.我们可以添加问题标签，比如不是吗？可以吗？或者他们没有？将一个陈述变成一个问题。问题标签在口语中比在写作中更常见。</p><p>We often use question tags when we expect the listener to agree with our statement. In this case, when the statement is positive, we use a negative question tag.当我们希望听众同意我们的陈述时，我们经常使用问题标签。在这种情况下，当陈述是肯定的时，我们使用否定问号。</p><blockquote><p><em>She</em><em>‘s</em>* a doctor, <strong>isn’t</strong> she?*  她是一名医生，不是吗？<br><em>Yesterday <strong>was</strong> so much fun, <strong>wasn’t</strong> it?</em>  昨天真是太有趣了，不是吗？</p></blockquote><p>If the statement is negative, we use a positive question tag. 如果陈述是否定的，我们使用肯定的问号。</p><blockquote><p><em>He <strong>isn’t</strong> here, <strong>is</strong> he?</em>  他不在这儿，是吗？<br><em>The trains <strong>are never</strong> on time, <strong>are</strong> they?</em>  火车从来都不准时，是吗？<br><strong>Nobody has</strong> called for me, <strong>have</strong> they?  他们没有人叫我，是吗？</p></blockquote><p>If we are sure or almost sure that the listener will confirm that our statement is correct, we say the question tag with a falling intonation. If we are a bit less sure, we say the question tag with a rising intonation.  如果我们确定或几乎确定听众会确认我们的陈述是正确的，我们就会用降调说问号。如果我们不太确定，我们会用升调说问号。</p><h4 id="Formation-编队"><a href="#Formation-编队" class="headerlink" title="Formation-编队"></a>Formation-编队</h4><p>If there is an auxiliary verb in the statement, we use it to form the question tag.如果陈述中有助动词，我们用它来构成疑问句。</p><blockquote><p><em>I <strong>don’t</strong> need to finish this today, <strong>do</strong> I?</em>  我今天不需要完成这个，是吗？<br><em>James <strong>is</strong> working on that, <strong>isn’t</strong> he?</em>  詹姆斯正在努力解决这个问题，不是吗？<br><em>Your parents <strong>have</strong> retired, <strong>haven’t</strong> they?</em>  你的父母已经退休了，不是吗？<br><em>The phone <strong>didn’t</strong> ring, <strong>did</strong> it?</em>  电话没有响，是吗？<br><em>It <strong>was</strong> raining that day, <strong>wasn’t</strong> it?</em>  那天下雨了，不是吗？<br><em>Your mum <strong>hadn’t</strong> met him before, <strong>had</strong> she?</em>  你妈妈以前没见过他，是吗？</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes there is no auxiliary verb already in the statement. For example, when:有时陈述中没有助动词。例如，当：</p><p>… the verb in the statement is present simple or past simple and is positive. Here we use <em>don’t</em>, <em>doesn’t</em> or <em>didn’t</em>:…陈述中的动词是简单现在时或过去简单且是肯定的。这里我们使用 don’t、don’t 或 did not：</p><blockquote><p><em>Jenni <strong>eats</strong> cheese, <strong>doesn’t</strong> she?</em>  珍妮吃奶酪，不是吗？<br><em>I <strong>said</strong> that already, <strong>didn’t</strong> I?</em>   我已经说过了，不是吗？</p></blockquote><p>… the verb in the statement is <em>to be</em> in the present simple or past simple. In this case we use <em>to be</em> to make the question tag:…陈述中的动词是现在简单或过去简单。在这种情况下，我们使用 be 来制作问题标签：</p><blockquote><p><em>The bus stop</em><em>‘s</em>* over there, <strong>isn’t</strong> it?*  公共汽车站就在那边，不是吗？<br><em><strong>None</strong> of those customers <strong>were</strong> happy, <strong>were</strong> they?</em>  这些顾客没有很高兴，不是吗？</p></blockquote><p>… the verb in the statement is a modal verb. Here we use the modal verb to make the question tag:…陈述中的动词是情态动词。这里我们使用情态动词来制作问号：</p><blockquote><p><em>They <strong>could</strong> hear me, <strong>couldn’t</strong> they?</em>  他们能听到我的声音，不是吗？<br><em>You <strong>won’t</strong> tell anyone, <strong>will</strong> you?</em>  你不会告诉任何人，是吗？</p></blockquote><p>If the main verb or auxiliary verb in the statement is <em>am</em>, the positive question tag is <em>am I?</em> but the negative question tag is usually <em>aren’t I?</em>:如果陈述句中的主动词或助动词是 am，则肯定疑问句是 am I？但否定疑问句标签通常是“不是吗？”：</p><blockquote><p><em>I</em><em>‘m never</em>* on time, <strong>am I</strong>?*  我从来都不准时，是吗？<br><em>I</em><em>‘m</em>* going to get an email with the details, <strong>aren’t I</strong>?*  我会收到一封包含详细信息的电子邮件，不是吗？</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Question-tags-2"><a href="#Question-tags-2" class="headerlink" title="Question tags: 2"></a>Question tags: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct question tag.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>Aki didn’t say much, _____?<br>had he<br>did he</li><li>I wasn’t rude, _____?<br>was I<br>wasn’t I</li><li>We should have turned left, _____?<br>haven’t we<br>shouldn’t we</li><li>None of the printers are working, _____?<br>are they<br>aren’t they</li><li>I’m giving the next presentation, _____?<br>aren’t I<br>I aren’t</li><li>She can’t meet on Mondays, _____?<br>could she<br>can she</li><li>You usually take the bus, _____?<br>don’t you<br>doesn’t you</li><li>Selim and Jess had been seeing each other for years, _____?<br>hadn’t they<br>been they</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>Aki didn’t say much, _____?<br>had he<br>did he</li><li>I wasn’t rude, _____?<br>was I<br>wasn’t I</li><li>We should have turned left, _____?<br>haven’t we<br>shouldn’t we</li><li>None of the printers are working, _____?<br>are they<br>aren’t they</li><li>I’m giving the next presentation, _____?<br>aren’t I<br>I aren’t</li><li>She can’t meet on Mondays, _____?<br>could she<br>can she</li><li>You usually take the bus, _____?<br>don’t you<br>doesn’t you</li><li>Selim and Jess had been seeing each other for years, _____?<br>hadn’t they<br>been they</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

They are made up of a verb and a particle or, sometimes, two particles. The particle often changes the meaning of the verb.  短语动词在英语中非常常见，尤其是在非正式的上下文中。它们由一个动词和一个助词组成，有时由两个助词组成。助词经常改变动词的含义。</p><blockquote><p><em>I called Jen to see how she was.</em> (<em>call</em> &#x3D; to telephone)  我打电话给珍，看看她怎么样了。 （呼叫 &#x3D; 拨打电话）<br><em>They’ve called off the meeting.</em>  他们取消了会议。(<em>call off</em> &#x3D; to cancel)（call off &#x3D; 取消）</p></blockquote><p>In terms of word order, there are two main types of phrasal verb: separable and inseparable. 从词序来看，短语动词主要有两种类型：可分离的和不可分离的。</p><h4 id="Separable-可分离"><a href="#Separable-可分离" class="headerlink" title="Separable-可分离"></a>Separable-可分离</h4><p>With separable phrasal verbs, the verb and particle can be apart or together.  对于可分离短语动词，动词和助词可以分开，也可以在一起。</p><blockquote><p><em>They’ve <strong>called</strong> the meeting <strong>off</strong>.</em>  他们取消了会议。<br>OR或者<br><em>They’ve <strong>called off</strong> the meeting.</em>  他们已经取消了会议。</p></blockquote><p>However, separable phrasal verbs must be separated when you use a personal pronoun. 但是，当您使用人称代词时，可分离短语动词必须分开。</p><blockquote><p><em>The meeting? They’ve <strong>called</strong> it <strong>off</strong> .</em>  会议？他们已经取消了。</p></blockquote><p>Here are some common separable phrasal verbs:  以下是一些常见的可分离短语动词：</p><blockquote><p><em>I didn’t want to <strong>bring</strong> the situation <strong>up</strong> at the meeting.</em>  我不想在会议上提出这个情况。<br>(<em>bring up</em> &#x3D; start talking about a particular subject)（提出&#x3D;开始谈论某个特定主题）</p><p><em>Please can you <strong>fill</strong> this form <strong>in</strong> ?</em>  请您填写这张表格好吗？<br>(<em>fill in</em> &#x3D; write information in a form or document)（填写&#x3D;在表格或文件中写入信息）</p><p><em>I’ll  <strong>pick</strong> you <strong>up</strong> from the station at 8 p.m.</em>  晚上八点我会到车站接你。<br>(<em>pick up</em> &#x3D; collect someone in a car or other vehicle to take them somewhere)（pick up &#x3D; 用汽车或其他车辆接人，带他们去某个地方）</p><p><em>She  <strong>turned</strong> the job  <strong>down</strong> because she didn’t want to move to Glasgow.</em>  她拒绝了这份工作，因为她不想搬到格拉斯哥。<br>(<em>turn down</em> &#x3D; to not accept an offer)（拒绝&#x3D;不接受要约）</p></blockquote><h4 id="Non-separable-不可分离"><a href="#Non-separable-不可分离" class="headerlink" title="Non-separable-不可分离"></a>Non-separable-不可分离</h4><p>Some phrasal verbs cannot be separated. 有些动词短语是不能分开的。</p><blockquote><p><em>Who <strong>looks after</strong> the baby when you’re at work?</em>  你上班的时候谁照顾孩子？</p></blockquote><p>Even when there is a personal pronoun, the verb and particle remain together.即使有人称代词，动词和助词仍然在一起。</p><blockquote><p><em>Who <strong>looks after</strong> her when you’re at work?</em>  你上班的时候谁照顾她？</p></blockquote><p>Here are some common non-separable phrasal verbs:  以下是一些常见的不可分离短语动词：</p><blockquote><p><em>I <strong>came across</strong> your email when I was clearing my inbox.</em>  我在清理收件箱时看到了你的电子邮件。<br>(<em>come across</em> &#x3D; to find something by chance)（偶然发现&#x3D;偶然发现某事）</p><p><em>The caterpillar <strong>turned into</strong> a beautiful butterfly.</em>  毛毛虫变成了一只美丽的蝴蝶。<br>(<em>turn into</em> &#x3D; become)（变成&#x3D;成为）</p><p><em>It was quite a major operation. It took months to <strong>get over</strong> it and feel normal again.</em>  这是一次相当大的手术。我花了几个月的时间才克服它并再次感觉正常。<br>(<em>get over</em> &#x3D; recover from something)（克服&#x3D;从某件事中恢复过来）</p><p><em>We are aware of the problem and we are <strong>looking into</strong> it.</em>  我们已经意识到这个问题，并且正在调查它。<br>(<em>look into</em> &#x3D; investigate)（调查&#x3D;调查）</p></blockquote><p>Some multi-word verbs are inseparable simply because they don’t take an object.有些多词动词是不可分离的，仅仅因为它们不带宾语。</p><blockquote><p><em>I <strong>get up</strong> at 7 a.m.</em>  我早上7点起床</p></blockquote><h4 id="With-two-particles-两个部分"><a href="#With-two-particles-两个部分" class="headerlink" title="With two particles-两个部分"></a>With two particles-两个部分</h4><p>Phrasal verbs with two particles are also inseparable. Even if you use a personal pronoun, you put it after the particles.  带有两个助词的短语动词也是不可分割的。即使您使用人称代词，也要将其放在助词后面。</p><blockquote><p><em>Who <strong>came up with</strong> that idea?</em>  谁想出了这个主意？<br>(<em>come up with</em> &#x3D; think of an idea or plan)（想出&#x3D;想到一个想法或计划）</p><p><em>Let’s <strong>get rid of</strong> these old magazines to make more space.</em>  我们把这些旧杂志扔掉吧，腾出更多空间。<br>(<em>get rid of</em> &#x3D; remove or become free of something that you don’t want)（摆脱&#x3D;删除或摆脱你不想要的东西）</p><p><em>I didn’t really <strong>get on with</strong> my stepbrother when I was a teenager.</em>  当我十几岁的时候，我和我的继兄弟相处得并不好。<br>(<em>get on with</em> &#x3D; like and be friendly towards someone)（相处&#x3D;喜欢并对某人友善）</p><p><em>Can you hear that noise all the time? I don’t know how you <strong>put up with</strong> it.</em>  你能一直听到这种声音吗？我不知道你是怎么忍受的。<br>(<em>put up with</em> &#x3D; tolerate something difficult or annoying)（忍受&#x3D;忍受困难或烦人的事情）</p><p><em>The concert’s on Friday. I’m really <strong>looking forward to</strong> it.</em>  音乐会于周五举行。我真的非常期待。<br>(<em>look forward to</em> &#x3D; be happy and excited about something that is going to happen)（期待&#x3D;对即将发生的事情感到高兴和兴奋）</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Phrasal-verbs-2"><a href="#Phrasal-verbs-2" class="headerlink" title="Phrasal verbs: 2"></a>Phrasal verbs: 2</h4><p>Put the words in the correct order.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>Skip</p></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><img src="/2024/04/15/b1-b2-grammar-19-phrasal-verbs/image-20240529193658180.png" class="" title="image-20240529193658180"><img src="/2024/04/15/b1-b2-grammar-19-phrasal-verbs/image-20240529193708437.png" class="" title="image-20240529193708437"><img src="/2024/04/15/b1-b2-grammar-19-phrasal-verbs/image-20240529193721052.png" class="" title="image-20240529193721052"><img src="/2024/04/15/b1-b2-grammar-19-phrasal-verbs/image-20240529193732722.png" class="" title="image-20240529193732722"><img src="/2024/04/15/b1-b2-grammar-19-phrasal-verbs/image-20240529193743427.png" class="" title="image-20240529193743427"><img src="/2024/04/15/b1-b2-grammar-19-phrasal-verbs/image-20240529193754070.png" class="" title="image-20240529193754070"><img src="/2024/04/15/b1-b2-grammar-19-phrasal-verbs/image-20240529193803880.png" class="" title="image-20240529193803880"><img src="/2024/04/15/b1-b2-grammar-19-phrasal-verbs/image-20240529193816393.png" class="" title="image-20240529193816393">]]></content>

The following sentence has the same meaning.  我们以什么顺序说出这两个事件并不重要。下面这句话也有同样的意思。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>The thief had escaped</strong> when the police arrived.</em>  警察赶到时小偷已经逃跑了。</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong> that if there’s only a single event, we don’t use the past perfect, even if it happened a long time ago.  <strong>请注意</strong>，如果只有一个事件，我们不会使用过去完成时，即使它发生在很久以前。</p><blockquote><p><em>The Romans spoke Latin.</em> (NOT <em>The Romans had spoken Latin.</em>)罗马人讲拉丁语。 （不是：罗马人说了拉丁语。）</p></blockquote><h4 id="Past-perfect-after-before-过去完成时之后之前"><a href="#Past-perfect-after-before-过去完成时之后之前" class="headerlink" title="Past perfect after before-过去完成时之后之前"></a>Past perfect after <em>before</em>-过去完成时之后之前</h4><p>We can also use <em><strong>before</strong></em> + past perfect to show that an action was not done or was incomplete when the past simple action happened.  我们还可以使用before +过去完成时来表示过去简单动作发生时动作尚未完成或不完整。</p><blockquote><p><em>They left <strong>before I’d spoken</strong> to them.</em>  我还没跟他们说话他们就离开了。<br><em>Sadly, the author died <strong>before he’d finished</strong> the series.</em>  遗憾的是，作者在完成该系列之前就去世了。</p></blockquote><h4 id="Adverbs-副词"><a href="#Adverbs-副词" class="headerlink" title="Adverbs-副词"></a>Adverbs-副词</h4><p>We often use the adverbs <em><strong>already</strong></em> (&#x3D; ‘before the specified time’), <em><strong>still</strong></em> (&#x3D; as previously), <em><strong>just</strong></em> (&#x3D; ‘a very short time before the specified time’), <em><strong>ever</strong></em> (&#x3D; ‘at any time before the specified time’) or <em><strong>never</strong></em> (&#x3D; ‘at no time before the specified time’) with the past perfect. 我们经常使用副词<strong>already</strong>已经（&#x3D;“在指定时间之前”），<strong>still</strong>仍然（&#x3D;如前所述），<strong>just</strong>只是（&#x3D;“在指定时间之前很短的时间”），<strong>ever</strong>曾经（&#x3D;“在指定时间之前的任何时间” ) 或 <strong>never</strong>从不 (&#x3D; ‘在指定时间之前的任何时间’) 与过去完成时一起使用。</p><blockquote><p><em>I called his office but he’d already <strong>left</strong>.</em>  我给他的办公室打了电话，但他已经离开了。<br><em>It still hadn’t <strong>rained</strong> at the beginning of May.</em>  五月初，还没下雨。<br><em>I went to visit her when she’d just <strong>moved</strong> to Berlin.</em>  她刚搬到柏林时我去看望她。<br><em>It was the most beautiful photo I’d ever <strong>seen</strong>.</em>  这是我见过的最美丽的照片。<br><em>Had you ever <strong>visited</strong> London when you moved there?</em>  您搬到伦敦后曾经去过那里吗？<br><em>I’d never <strong>met</strong> anyone from California before I met Jim.</em>  在认识吉姆之前，我从未见过任何来自加利福尼亚州的人。</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.  做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Past-perfect-2"><a href="#Past-perfect-2" class="headerlink" title="Past perfect: 2"></a>Past perfect: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct option to complete the sentences.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>By the time I could talk to her, she ___ to quit her job.<br>decided<br>‘d decided</li><li>I looked at the photo and suddenly realised that I ___ that man somewhere before.<br>saw<br>‘d seen</li><li>First I ___ the salad, then I toasted the bread.<br>made<br>‘d made</li><li>___ breakfast when you got up?<br>Did James already cook<br>Had James already cooked</li><li>She didn’t feel like another coffee as she ___ one.<br>just had<br>‘d just had</li><li>We had the French exam this morning.

When did it open?</em>  那里以前没有超市。什么时候开的？<br><em>Did you <strong>use to have</strong> a garden?</em>  你以前有花园吗？</p></blockquote><p>We can also use <em>used to</em> to talk about past habits (repeated past actions) that don’t happen any more.我们还可以使用used to来谈论过去不再发生的习惯（重复过去的行为）。</p><blockquote><p><em>I <strong>used to</strong> go swimming every Thursday when I was at school.</em>  我上学时每周四都去游泳。<br><em>She used to smoke but she gave up a few years ago.</em>  她曾经抽烟，但几年前戒掉了。</p></blockquote><p><em>used to + infinitive</em> should not be confused with <em>be&#x2F;get used to + -ing</em>, which has a different meaning.  used to + 不定式不应与 be&#x2F;get used to + -ing 混淆，后者具有不同的含义。</p><h4 id="Would-会"><a href="#Would-会" class="headerlink" title="Would-会"></a><em><strong>Would-会</strong></em></h4><p>We can use <em>would</em> to talk about repeated past actions that don’t happen any more.  我们可以用 will 来谈论过去重复但不再发生的动作。</p><blockquote><p><em>Every Saturday I <strong>would</strong> go on a long bike ride.</em>  每个星期六我都会去骑长途自行车。<br><em>My dad <strong>would</strong> read me amazing stories every night at bedtime.</em>  我爸爸每天晚上睡觉前都会给我读一些精彩的故事。</p></blockquote><p><em>would</em> for past habits is slightly more formal than <em>used to.</em> It is often used in stories. We don’t normally use the negative or question form of <em>would</em> for past habits. Note that we can’t usually use <em>would</em> to talk about past states. <strong>would</strong>表示过去的习惯，比<strong>used to</strong>稍微正式一些。常用于故事中。我们通常不会用 <strong>would</strong> 的否定形式或疑问形式来表示过去的习惯。请注意，我们通常不能使用 <strong>would</strong> 来谈论过去的状态。</p><h4 id="Past-simple-一般过去时"><a href="#Past-simple-一般过去时" class="headerlink" title="Past simple-一般过去时"></a><em>Past simple</em>-一般过去时</h4><p>We can always use the past simple as an alternative to <em>used to</em> or <em>would</em> to talk about past states or habits. The main difference is that the past simple doesn’t emphasise the repeated or continuous nature of the action or situation. Also, the past simple doesn’t make it so clear that the thing is no longer true.我们总是可以用一般过去时来代替used to或would来谈论过去的状态或习惯。主要区别在于，简单过去时并不强调动作或情况的重复或连续性。而且，一般过去时并不能清楚地表明这件事不再是真的。</p><blockquote><p><em>We <strong>went to</strong> the same beach every summer.</em>  每年夏天我们都去同一个海滩。<br><em>We <strong>used to</strong> go to the same beach every summer.</em>  我们每年夏天都会去同一个海滩。<br><em>We <strong>would</strong> go to the same beach every summer.</em>  每年夏天我们都会去同一个海滩。</p></blockquote><p>If something happened only once, we must use the past simple.如果某件事只发生过一次，我们必须使用一般过去时。</p><blockquote><p><em>I <strong>went to</strong> Egypt in 2014. 2014</em>  年我去了埃及。</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Past-habits-2"><a href="#Past-habits-2" class="headerlink" title="Past habits: 2"></a>Past habits: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct option to complete the sentence.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>I ___ a really sporty person.<br>would be<br>used to be</li><li>In my first year at university, I ___ for an hour every morning before breakfast.<br>have run<br>would run</li><li>Then I ___ the university boxing team and I really started to train hard.<br>joined<br>used to join</li><li>During that time, I ___ to spend at least two hours in the gym every day.<br>would like<br>used to like</li><li>When I started my training, I ___ my diet completely.<br>would change<br>changed</li><li>I ___ three eggs with toast and fruit for breakfast.<br>have had<br>used to have</li><li>I ___ sugar in my tea because it wasn’t on my diet plan.<br>didn’t use to have<br>wouldn’t have</li><li>But then I ___ my arm and that was the end of my boxing career!<br>would break<br>broke</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>I ___ a really sporty person.<br>would be<br>✔used to be</li><li>In my first year at university, I ___ for an hour every morning before breakfast.<br>have run<br>✔would run</li><li>Then I ___ the university boxing team and I really started to train hard.<br>✔joined<br>used to join</li><li>During that time, I ___ to spend at least two hours in the gym every day.<br>would like<br>✔used to like</li><li>When I started my training, I ___ my diet completely.<br>would change<br>✔changed</li><li>I ___ three eggs with toast and fruit for breakfast.<br>have had<br>✔used to have</li><li>I ___ sugar in my tea because it wasn’t on my diet plan.<br>✔didn’t use to have<br>wouldn’t have</li><li>But then I ___ my arm and that was the end of my boxing career!<br>would break<br>✔broke</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>I <strong>used to be</strong> a really sporty person.<br>解释: “used to be” 表示过去的习惯或状态，与现在不同。而 “would be” 通常用于假设或意愿的表达，不适合这里的语境。</li><li>In my first year at university, I <strong>would run</strong> for an hour every morning before breakfast.<br>解释: “would run” 表示过去的习惯性动作，常常用在讲述过去的日常活动时。”have run” 是现在完成时，不适合描述过去的习惯。</li><li>Then I <strong>joined</strong> the university boxing team and I really started to train hard.<br>解释: “joined” 是一个过去简单时的动词，表示在过去某个具体的时间点加入了拳击队。”used to join” 结构不合适，因为 “used to” 表示过去习惯，而加入拳击队是一个具体事件。</li><li>During that time, I <strong>used to</strong> spend at least two hours in the gym every day.<br>解释: “used to” 适合表示过去的习惯性动作。”would like” 表示过去的意愿，但在这里不合适。</li><li>When I started my training, I <strong>changed</strong> my diet completely.<br>解释: “changed” 是一个过去简单时的动词，表示在过去某个具体的时间点改变了饮食习惯。”would change” 更适合假设句或表示重复的过去动作，但在这里不合适。</li><li>I <strong>used to have</strong> three eggs with toast and fruit for breakfast.<br>解释: “used to have” 表示过去的习惯性动作。”have had” 是现在完成时，不适合描述过去的习惯。</li><li>I <strong>didn’t use to have</strong> sugar in my tea because it wasn’t on my diet plan.<br>解释: “didn’t use to have” 表示过去习惯于没有糖。”wouldn’t have” 虽然也可以表示习惯，但通常用在假设句中，这里不太合适。</li><li>But then I <strong>broke</strong> my arm and that was the end of my boxing career!<br>解释: “broke” 是一个过去简单时的动词，表示在过去某个具体的时间点发生的事件。”would break” 用在假设句中，不适合这里的语境。</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

I can see her car in the garage.</em>  这一定是她的家。我可以在车库里看到她的车。<br><em>He <strong>must</strong> live near here because he always walks to work.</em>  他一定住在这附近，因为他总是步行去上班。<br><em>Come inside and get warm. You <strong>must</strong> be freezing out there!</em>  进来取暖吧。你在外面一定冻坏了！</p></blockquote><h4 id="might-may-could-可能、可能、可以"><a href="#might-may-could-可能、可能、可以" class="headerlink" title="might, may, could-可能、可能、可以"></a><em>might</em>, <em>may</em>, <em>could</em>-可能、可能、可以</h4><p>We use <em>might</em>, <em>may</em> or <em>could</em> to say that we think something is possible but we’re not sure. 我们用 might、may 或 could 来表示我们认为某件事是可能的，但我们不确定。</p><blockquote><p><em>She’s not here yet. She <strong>might</strong> be stuck in traffic.</em>  她还没来。她可能会遇到交通堵塞。<br><em>He’s not answering. He <strong>could</strong> be in class.</em>  他没有回答。他可能正在上课。<br><em>We regret to inform you that some services <strong>may</strong> be delayed due to the bad weather.</em>  我们很遗憾地通知您，由于恶劣天气，部分服务可能会延迟。</p></blockquote><p>They all have the same meaning, but <em>may</em> is more formal than <em>might</em> and <em>could</em>.它们都有相同的含义，但“may”比“might”和“could”更正式。</p><h4 id="can’t-不能"><a href="#can’t-不能" class="headerlink" title="can’t-不能"></a><em>can’t-不能</em></h4><p>We use <em>can’t</em> when we feel sure that something is not possible.当我们确信某件事不可能时，我们使用can’t。</p><blockquote><p><em>It <strong>can’t</strong> be far now. We’ve been driving for hours.</em>  现在已经不远了。我们已经开了好几个小时的车了。<br><em>She <strong>can’t</strong> know about the complaint. She’s promoted him to team leader.</em>  她不可能知道投诉的事。她已经把他提升为团队领导了。<br><em>It <strong>can’t</strong> be easy for him, looking after three kids on his own.</em>  独自照顾三个孩子对他来说并不容易。</p></blockquote><p>Note that these verbs, like all modal verbs, are followed by an infinitive without <em>to</em>.请注意，这些动词与所有情态动词一样，后面跟着不带 to 的不定式。</p><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Modals-–-deductions-about-the-present-2"><a href="#Modals-–-deductions-about-the-present-2" class="headerlink" title="Modals – deductions about the present: 2"></a>Modals – deductions about the present: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct option to complete the sentences.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The house isn’t hard to find.

They can all be used at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence.  “Although”， “even though”， “in spite of” 和 “despite”都用于连接两个相反的想法或表明一个事实使另一个事实令人惊讶。它们都可以用在句子的开头或中间。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Despite</strong> the rain, we enjoyed the festival.</em>  尽管下着雨，我们还是很享受这个节日。<br><em>We enjoyed the festival, <strong>despite</strong> the rain.</em>  尽管下着雨，我们还是很享受这个节日。</p></blockquote><p>The main difference between <em>although</em>, <em>even though</em>, <em>in spite of</em> and <em>despite</em> is that they are used with different structures. “Although”， “even though”， “in spite of” 和 “despite”之间的主要区别在于它们使用不同的结构。</p><h4 id="in-spite-of-despite-“in-spite-of”-和-“despite”"><a href="#in-spite-of-despite-“in-spite-of”-和-“despite”" class="headerlink" title="in spite of &#x2F; despite-“in spite of” 和 “despite”"></a><em>in spite of</em> &#x2F; <em>despite</em>-“in spite of” 和 “despite”</h4><p>After <em>in spite of</em> and <em>despite</em>, we use a noun, gerund (-<em>ing</em> form of a verb) or a pronoun. 在“in spite of” 和 “despite”之后，我们使用名词、动名词（动词的-ing形式）或代词。</p><blockquote><p><em>They never made much money, <strong>in spite of</strong> their success.</em>  尽管他们取得了成功，但他们从未赚过多少钱。<br><em><strong>In spite of</strong> the pain in his leg, he completed the marathon.</em>  尽管腿很痛，他还是完成了马拉松比赛。<br><em><strong>Despite</strong> having a headache, I had a great birthday.</em>  尽管头疼，我还是度过了一个愉快的生日。<br><em>The train was cancelled. <strong>In spite of</strong> that, we arrived on time.</em>  火车被取消了。尽管如此，我们还是准时到达了。</p></blockquote><p>Note that it is common to use <em>in spite of</em> and <em>despite</em> with the expression <em>the fact that</em>, followed by a subject and verb.  请注意，通常“in spite of” 和 “despite”与<em>the fact that</em>一起使用时，后跟主语和动词。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>In spite of the fact that</strong> he worked very hard, he didn’t pass the exam.</em>  尽管他非常努力，但他还是没有通过考试。<br><em><strong>Despite the fact that</strong> he worked very hard, he didn’t pass the exam.</em>  尽管他非常努力，但他还是没有通过考试。</p></blockquote><h4 id="although-even-though-尽管-尽管"><a href="#although-even-though-尽管-尽管" class="headerlink" title="although &#x2F; even though-尽管&#x2F;尽管"></a><em>although</em> &#x2F; <em>even though</em>-尽管&#x2F;尽管</h4><p>After <em>although</em> and <em>even though</em>, we use a subject and a verb. <em>Even though</em> is slightly stronger and more emphatic than <em>although</em>.  在“although”和“even though”之后，我们使用主语和动词。 “Even though”比“although”稍强、更强调。</p><blockquote><p><em>I enjoyed the course, <strong>although</strong> I would have liked more grammar practice.</em>  我很喜欢这门课程，尽管我希望有更多的语法练习。<br><em><strong>Although</strong> we saw each other every day, we didn’t really know each other.</em>  虽然我们每天都见面，但我们并不真正了解对方。<br><em><strong>Even though</strong> she spoke very quietly, he understood every word.</em>  虽然她说得很小声，但他却听懂了每一个字。<br><em>She didn’t get the job, <strong>even though</strong> she had all the necessary qualifications.</em>  尽管她具备所有必要的资格，但她没有得到这份工作。</p></blockquote><h4 id="though-尽管"><a href="#though-尽管" class="headerlink" title="though-尽管"></a><em>though</em>-尽管</h4><p><em>Though</em> can be used in the same way as <em>although</em>. “Though”的用法与 “although”相同。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Though</strong> I wasn’t keen on the film, I thought the music was beautiful.</em>  虽然我不喜欢这部电影，但我觉得音乐很美。</p></blockquote><p><em>Though</em> can also go at the end of the second phrase. This way of expressing contrasting ideas is most common in spoken English.  “Though” 也可以放在第二个短语的末尾。这种表达对比思想的方式在英语口语中最常见。</p><blockquote><p><em>We waited ages for our food. The waiter was really nice, <strong>though</strong>.</em>  我们等了很长时间才等到我们的食物。不过服务员真的很好。</p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="‘in-spite-of’-‘despite’-‘although’-‘even-though’-and-‘though’-2"><a href="#‘in-spite-of’-‘despite’-‘although’-‘even-though’-and-‘though’-2" class="headerlink" title="‘in spite of’, ‘despite’, ‘although’, ‘even though’ and ‘though’: 2"></a>‘in spite of’, ‘despite’, ‘although’, ‘even though’ and ‘though’: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct option to complete the sentences.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>We decided to buy the house, _____ we didn’t really have enough money.<br>despite<br>in spite of<br>even though</li><li>_____ my careful planning, we ended up staying in a really bad hotel.<br>Despite<br>Although<br>Even though</li><li>My partner snores really loudly but _____ that I sleep well.<br>even though<br>in spite of<br>although</li><li>You keep making that stupid noise _____ I’ve asked you to stop three times.<br>despite<br>in spite of<br>even though</li><li>I won the race _____ coming last in the practice run.<br>although<br>in spite of<br>even though</li><li>You told me ten times.

Some words are also different in each variety of English, and there are also a few differences in the way they use grammar. Here are five of the most common grammatical differences between British and American English.英式英语和美式英语的主要区别在于发音。有些单词在各个英语变种中也有所不同，并且它们使用语法的方式也存在一些差异。以下是英式英语和美式英语之间五个最常见的语法差异。</p><h4 id="1-Present-perfect-and-past-simple-1-现在完成时和一般过去时"><a href="#1-Present-perfect-and-past-simple-1-现在完成时和一般过去时" class="headerlink" title="1.

Present perfect and past simple-1. 现在完成时和一般过去时</h4><p>In British English, people use the present perfect to speak about a past action that they consider relevant to the present. 在英式英语中，人们使用现在完成时来谈论他们认为与现在相关的过去行为。</p><p>The present perfect can be used in the same way in American English, but people often use the past simple when they consider the action finished. This is especially common with the adverbs <em>already</em>, <em>just</em> and <em>yet</em>.现在完成时在美式英语中也可以用同样的方式使用，但是人们在考虑动作完成时经常使用一般过去时。这在副词“already”、“just”和“yet”中尤其常见。</p><table><thead><tr><th>British English英式英语</th><th>American English美式英语</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>He isn’t hungry.

Verb forms with collective nouns-3. 集体名词的动词形式</h4><p>In British English, a singular or plural verb can be used with a noun that refers to a group of people or things (a collective noun). We use a plural verb when we think of the group as individuals or a singular verb when we think of the group as a single unit.在英式英语中，单数或复数动词可以与指代一群人或事物的名词（集体名词）一起使用。当我们将群体视为个体时，我们使用复数动词；当我们将群体视为单个单位时，我们使用单数动词。</p><p>In American English, a singular verb is used with collective nouns.在美式英语中，单数动词与集体名词一起使用。</p><p><strong>Note that <em>police</em> is always followed by a plural verb.</strong> 请注意，police 后面总是跟有复数动词。</p><table><thead><tr><th>British English英式英语</th><th>American English美式英语</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>My family is&#x2F;are visiting from Pakistan.我的家人正在从巴基斯坦来访。 My team is&#x2F;are winning the match.我的球队正在赢得比赛。 The crew is&#x2F;are on the way to the airport.机组人员正在前往机场的路上。</em>BUT:但： <em>The police are investigating the crime.警方正在调查这起犯罪事件。</em></td><td><em>My family is visiting from Pakistan.我的家人从巴基斯坦来访。 My team is winning the match.我的球队正在赢得比赛。 The crew is on the way to the airport.工作人员正在前往机场的路上。</em>BUT:但： <em>The police are investigating the crime.警方正在调查这起犯罪事件。</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="4-have-and-take-4-拥有并取得"><a href="#4-have-and-take-4-拥有并取得" class="headerlink" title="4. have and take-4. 拥有并取得"></a>4. <em>have</em> and <em>take</em>-4. 拥有并取得</h4><p>In British English, the verbs <em>have</em> and <em>take</em> are commonly used with nouns like <em>bath</em>, <em>shower</em>, <em>wash</em> to speak about washing and with nouns like <em>break</em>, <em>holiday</em>, <em>rest</em> to speak about resting. 在英式英语中，动词have和take通常与bath、shower、wash等名词一起使用来表示洗涤，与break、holiday、rest等名词一起使用来表示休息。</p><p>In American English, only the verb <em>take</em> (and not the verb <em>have</em>) is used this way.在美式英语中，只有动词 take（而不是动词 have）才会这样使用。</p><table><thead><tr><th>British English英式英语</th><th>American English美式英语</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>I’m going to have&#x2F;take a shower.我要去洗澡。 Let’s have&#x2F;take a break.我们休息一下吧。</em></td><td><em>I’m going to take a shower.我要去洗澡。 Let’s take a break.休息一下吧。</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="5-shall-5-应当"><a href="#5-shall-5-应当" class="headerlink" title="5. shall-5. 应当"></a>5. <em>shall</em>-5. 应当</h4><p>In British English, people often use <em>Shall I …?</em> to offer to do something and&#x2F;or <em>Shall we …?</em> to make a suggestion. 在英式英语中，人们经常使用Shall I …？主动提出做某事和&#x2F;或我们可以……吗？提出建议。</p><p>It is very unusual for speakers of American English to use <em>shall</em>. They normally use an alternative like <em>Should</em>&#x2F;<em>Can I …?</em> or <em>Do you want</em>&#x2F;<em>Would you like …?</em> or <em>How about …?</em> instead. 对于说美式英语的人来说，使用“shall”是很不寻常的。他们通常使用替代方案，例如“我应该&#x2F;可以……吗？”或你想要&#x2F;你愿意…吗？或者…怎么样？反而。</p><table><thead><tr><th>British English英式英语</th><th>American English美式英语</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>It’s hot in here.

This means we can have different levels of that quality. For example, you can be <em>a bit cold</em>, <em>very cold</em> or <em>extremely cold.</em> We can make them weaker or stronger with modifiers:大多数形容词都是可分级的。这意味着我们可以拥有不同级别的质量。例如，您可能有点冷、非常冷或极冷。我们可以使用修饰符使它们变弱或变强：</p><blockquote><p><em>She was quite angry when she found out.她知道后非常生气。<br>The film we saw last night was really funny!我们昨晚看的电影真的很有趣！<br>It can be extremely cold in Russia in the winter.俄罗斯的冬天可能非常寒冷。</em></p></blockquote><p>Here is a list of some common gradable adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.以下是一些常见的可评分形容词以及我们可以与它们一起使用的一些修饰语的列表。</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Modifiers修饰符</strong></th><th><em>a little&#x2F;a bit</em> →一点点&#x2F;一点点 →</th><th><em>pretty&#x2F;quite</em> →漂亮&#x2F;相当 →</th><th><em>really&#x2F;very</em> →真的&#x2F;非常→</th><th><em>extremely极其</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Adjectives形容词</strong></td><td><em>angry</em>, <em>big</em>, <em>boring</em>, <em>cheap, cold</em>, <em>expensive</em>, <em>frightening, funny</em>, <em>hot</em>, <em>interesting</em>, <em>old</em>, <em>pretty</em>, <em>small</em>, <em>tasty</em>, <em>tired</em>, etc.生气、大、无聊、便宜、冷、贵、可怕、有趣、热、有趣、老、漂亮、小、好吃、累等等。</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Non-gradable-absolute-adjectives-不可分级：绝对形容词"><a href="#Non-gradable-absolute-adjectives-不可分级：绝对形容词" class="headerlink" title="Non-gradable: absolute adjectives-不可分级：绝对形容词"></a>Non-gradable: absolute adjectives-不可分级：绝对形容词</h4><p>Some adjectives are non-gradable. For example, something can’t be <em>a bit finished</em> or <em>very finished</em>. You can’t be <em>a bit dead</em> or <em>very dead</em>. These adjectives describe absolute qualities. To make them stronger we have to use modifiers like <em>absolutely</em>, <em>totally</em> or <em>completely</em>:有些形容词是不可分级的。例如，某件事不能有点完成或非常完成。你不能有点死了或者死得很厉害。这些形容词描述了绝对的品质。为了使它们更强大，我们必须使用修饰语，例如绝对、完全或完全：</p><blockquote><p><em>Thank you, I love it! It’s absolutely perfect!谢谢你，我喜欢它！绝对是完美的！<br>Their farm was totally destroyed by a tornado.他们的农场被龙卷风完全摧毁了。<br>My work is completely finished. Now I can relax.我的工作已经彻底完成了。现在我可以放松了。</em></p></blockquote><p>Here is a list of some common absolute adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.这里列出了一些常见的绝对形容词以及我们可以与它们一起使用的一些修饰语。</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Modifiers修饰符</strong></th><th><em>absolutely&#x2F;totally&#x2F;completely绝对&#x2F;完全&#x2F;完全</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Adjectives形容词</strong></td><td><em>acceptable</em>, <em>dead</em>, <em>destroyed</em>, <em>finished</em>, <em>free</em>, <em>impossible</em>, <em>necessary</em>, <em>perfect</em>, <em>ruined</em>, <em>unacceptable</em>, etc.可接受的、死亡的、被破坏的、完成的、自由的、不可能的、必要的、完美的、被毁掉的、不可接受的等等。</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Non-gradable-extreme-adjectives不可分级：极端形容词"><a href="#Non-gradable-extreme-adjectives不可分级：极端形容词" class="headerlink" title="Non-gradable: extreme adjectives不可分级：极端形容词"></a>Non-gradable: extreme adjectives不可分级：极端形容词</h4><p>Adjectives like <em><strong>amazing</strong></em>, <em><strong>awful</strong></em> and <em><strong>boiling</strong></em> are also non-gradable. They already contain the idea of ‘<strong>very</strong>‘ in their definitions. If we want to make extreme adjectives stronger, we have to use <em>absolutely</em> or <em>really</em>:像惊人的、可怕的和沸腾这样的形容词也是不可分级的。他们的定义中已经包含了“非常”的概念。如果我们想让极端形容词变得更强，我们必须使用absolutely或really：</p><blockquote><p><em>Did you see the final match? It was absolutely amazing!你看过决赛吗？这绝对是太棒了！<br>After 32 hours of travelling, they were absolutely exhausted.经过32个小时的旅途，他们已经筋疲力尽了。<br>My trip home was really awful.

Often we feel this amount is not enough or less than we expected. <em>Few</em> is for countable nouns and <em>very little</em> is for uncountable nouns.我们使用<em>few</em>和<em>very little</em>来表明我们正在谈论少量。我们常常觉得这个数额不够或低于我们的预期。<em>Few</em>用于可数名词，<em>very little</em> 用于不可数名词。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Few</strong> people came to the meeting.参加会议的人很少。</em><br><em>There are <strong>few</strong> places where you can still see these birds.现在很少有地方还能看到这些鸟了。</em><br><em>We have <strong>very little</strong> time.我们的时间很少。</em><br><em>I have <strong>very little</strong> money.我的钱很少。</em></p></blockquote><p>Note that you can use <em>little</em> without <em>very</em>, but it is less common and sounds quite formal. 请注意，您可以在不使用very 的情况下使用little，但它不太常见，而且听起来很正式。</p><blockquote><p><em>She had <strong>little</strong> water.她的水很少。</em></p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h4 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h4><table><thead><tr><th>单词或短语</th><th>用法</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>a few</td><td>复数名词</td></tr><tr><td>a bit of</td><td>不可数名词</td></tr><tr><td>a little</td><td>不可数名词</td></tr><tr><td>Few</td><td>可数名词</td></tr><tr><td>very little</td><td>不可数名词</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Countable-and-uncountable-nouns-2-2"><a href="#Countable-and-uncountable-nouns-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Countable and uncountable nouns 2: 2"></a>Countable and uncountable nouns 2: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct option.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>We have _____ ideas.<br>a few<br>a bit of</li><li>There is _____ space in this room.<br>few<br>very little</li><li>Can you give that plant _____ water?<br>a few<br>a bit of</li><li>_____ houses have central heating here.<br>Few<br>Very little</li><li>The doctor told me to rest for _____ days.<br>few<br>a few</li><li>I have _____ information about this.<br>few<br>very little</li><li>It’s a difficult situation and _____ countries want to help.<br>few<br>very little</li><li>I’ll come later.

Regular past simple verbs have -<em>ed</em> at the end (e.g. <em>called</em>, <em>played</em>, <em>arrived</em>). Irregular verbs have a different form, usually with a different vowel sound (e.g. <em>wake</em> → <em>woke</em>, <em>break</em> → <em>broke</em>, <em>feel</em> → <em>felt</em>).一般过去时向我们表明某个动作是过去发生的，而不是现在发生的。常规一般过去动词末尾有 -ed（例如，叫、玩、到达）。不规则动词有不同的形式，通常具有不同的元音（例如wake→wake、break→broken、feel→feeled）。</p><blockquote><p><em>My parents called me yesterday.</em> 我的父母昨天给我打电话。<br><em>I woke up early this morning.</em> 我今天早上很早就醒了。<br><em>Sam played basketball when he was at university.</em> 萨姆在大学时打篮球。</p></blockquote><p>We make the negative with <em>didn’t</em> and the infinitive verb.我们用 did not 和不定式动词构成否定形式。</p><blockquote><p><em>My parents didn’t call me yesterday.</em> 昨天我父母没有给我打电话。<br><em>I didn’t wake up early this morning.</em> 今天早上我没有早起。</p></blockquote><p>We make the question form with <em>did</em> and then the subject and infinitive verb.我们用 did 来构成疑问句，然后是主语和不定式动词。</p><blockquote><p><em>Did you wake up early this morning?</em> 今天早上你起得很早吗？<br><em>Did Sam play basketball when he was at university?</em> 萨姆在大学时打篮球吗？</p></blockquote><h4 id="Past-continuous过去进行时"><a href="#Past-continuous过去进行时" class="headerlink" title="Past continuous过去进行时"></a>Past continuous过去进行时</h4><p>The past continuous shows us that the action was already in progress at a certain time in the past.过去进行时向我们表明该动作在过去的某个时间已经在进行中。</p><blockquote><p><em>What were you doing at 8 p.m. last night?</em> 昨夜晚上八点你在做什么？<br><em>I was studying.</em> 我那时正在学习。</p></blockquote><p>This means that I started studying before 8 p.m. and I continued after 8 p.m.这意味着我晚上8点之前就开始学习了。晚上 8 点后我继续。</p><p>The past continuous can also show that an activity was in progress for some time, not just for a moment.过去进行时也可以表明一项活动已经进行了一段时间，而不仅仅是一会儿。</p><blockquote><p><em>We were cleaning the house all morning.</em> 我们整个早上都在打扫房子。</p></blockquote><p>We make the past continuous with <em>was</em> or <em>were</em> and the -<em>ing</em> form of the verb.我们用 was 或 were 以及动词的 -ing 形式使过去进行时。</p><blockquote><p><em>She couldn’t come to the party. She was working.</em> 她不能来参加聚会。她正在工作。<br><em>Three years ago, we were living in my home town.</em> 三年前，我们住在我的家乡。<br><em>I tried to give him some advice, but he wasn’t listening.</em> 我试图给他一些建议，但他不听。<br><em>What were you doing this time last year?</em> 去年这个时候你在做什么？</p></blockquote><h4 id="Past-continuous-and-past-simple过去进行时和一般过去时"><a href="#Past-continuous-and-past-simple过去进行时和一般过去时" class="headerlink" title="Past continuous and past simple过去进行时和一般过去时"></a>Past continuous and past simple过去进行时和一般过去时</h4><p>When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the past simple action happened in the middle of the past continuous action, while it was in progress.当我们同时使用这两个时态时，它表明过去的简单动作发生在过去的连续动作的中间，并且正在进行。</p><blockquote><p><em>While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy.</em> 正当我学习的时候，我突然感到困了。</p></blockquote><p>We often use these tenses to show an action interrupting another action.我们经常使用这些时态来表示一个动作打断另一个动作。</p><blockquote><p><em>I broke my leg when I was skiing.</em> 我滑雪时摔断了腿。<br><em>As I was going to work, I saw an old friend.</em> 当我去上班的时候，我见到了一位老朋友。<br><em>We were watching television when the power went off.</em> 我们正在看电视，突然停电了。</p></blockquote><p>Can you see a difference in the meaning of these two sentences?你能看出这两句话的意思有什么不同吗？</p><blockquote><p><em>When the guests arrived, Jane was cooking dinner.</em> 客人到来时，简正在做饭。<br><em>When the guests arrived, Jane cooked dinner.</em> 客人到来后，简做饭了。</p></blockquote><p>In the first one, Jane started cooking dinner before the guests arrived. We know that because it uses the past continuous. In the second sentence, the guests arrived first and then Jane started cooking.第一个场景中，简在客人到来之前开始做饭。我们知道这一点是因为它使用了过去进行时。第二句话，客人先到了，然后简然开始做饭。</p><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Past-continuous-and-past-simple-2"><a href="#Past-continuous-and-past-simple-2" class="headerlink" title="Past continuous and past simple: 2"></a>Past continuous and past simple: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct verb tense.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>I _____ my new job yesterday.<br>started<br>was starting</li><li>What _____ at around 8 a.m. this morning?<br>did you do<br>were you doing</li><li>While I was washing the dishes, I suddenly _____ a brilliant idea.<br>had<br>was having</li><li>He didn’t hear the phone ring.

There are no grammatical rules for which preposition is used with which adjective, so it’s a good idea to try to learn them together. To help you do this, write new vocabulary in your notebook in a sentence or phrase.有些形容词与某些介词搭配。介词与形容词的使用没有语法规则，因此最好尝试一起学习它们。为了帮助您做到这一点，请在笔记本上用句子或短语写下新词汇。</p><p>However, there are some patterns that can help you. Let’s look at them first. Remember that a preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (<em>-ing</em> form).但是，有一些模式可以帮助您。我们先来看看它们。请记住，介词后跟名词或动名词（-ing 形式）。</p><h4 id="With-at-使用at"><a href="#With-at-使用at" class="headerlink" title="With at 使用at"></a>With <em>at</em> 使用at</h4><p>We use <em>at</em> with adjectives like <em>good</em>&#x2F;<em>bad</em>&#x2F;<em>amazing</em>&#x2F;<em>brilliant</em>&#x2F;<em>terrible</em>, etc. to talk about skills and abilities.我们将 at 与好&#x2F;坏&#x2F;惊人&#x2F;辉煌&#x2F;可怕等形容词一起使用来谈论技能和能力。</p><blockquote><p><em>He’s really <strong>good at</strong> English.他英语真的很好。<br>She’s <strong>amazing at</strong> the piano.她的钢琴弹得很棒。<br>They’re <strong>terrible at</strong> organising anything.他们不擅长组织任何事情。<br>I’m not very <strong>good at</strong> drawing.我不太擅长画画。</em></p></blockquote><h4 id="With-about-使用about"><a href="#With-about-使用about" class="headerlink" title="With about 使用about"></a>With <em>about</em> 使用about</h4><p>We often use <em>about</em> with adjectives of feelings like <em>angry</em>&#x2F;<em>excited</em>&#x2F;<em>happy</em>&#x2F;<em>nervous</em>&#x2F;<em>sad</em>&#x2F;<em>stressed</em>&#x2F;<em>worried</em>, etc. to explain what is causing that feeling.我们经常将 about 与表示感觉的形容词一起使用，例如愤怒&#x2F;兴奋&#x2F;快乐&#x2F;紧张&#x2F;悲伤&#x2F;压力&#x2F;担心等来解释是什么导致了这种感觉。</p><blockquote><p><em>I’m <strong>angry about</strong> the decision.我对这个决定感到愤怒。<br>He’s <strong>nervous about</strong> the presentation.他对演讲感到紧张。<br>She’s <strong>excited about</strong> the new job.她对新工作感到很兴奋。<br>They were <strong>worried about</strong> the exam.他们很担心考试。</em></p></blockquote><h4 id="With-of-使用of"><a href="#With-of-使用of" class="headerlink" title="With of 使用of"></a>With <em>of</em> 使用of</h4><p>However, sometimes we use <em>of</em> with feelings.然而，有时我们会用of来表达感情。</p><blockquote><p><em>She was

to show the connection between people or things.我们可以用 to 来表示人或事物之间的联系。</p><blockquote><p><em>He’s <strong>married to</strong> the director.他和导演结婚了。<br>I’m <strong>addicted to</strong> my phone.我对手机上瘾了。<br>I’m <strong>allergic to</strong> nuts.我对坚果过敏。<br>It’s <strong>similar to</strong> the old one.这和旧的很相似。</em></p></blockquote><p>We can also use <em>to</em> to talk about someone’s behaviour towards someone else.我们还可以使用 to 来谈论某人对其他人的行为。</p><blockquote><p><em>They were really <strong>friendly to</strong> me.他们对我真的很友好。<br>Was he <strong>nice to</strong> you?他对你好吗？<br>He is always <strong>polite to</strong> everyone.他对每个人总是很有礼貌。<br>She was very <strong>rude to</strong> the waitress.她对女服务员非常粗鲁。</em></p></blockquote><p>Here are some other useful adjectives with

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="\assets\css\APlayer.min.css"><script src="\assets\js\APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><h2 id="【C1-Listening】Bad-Smells-in-Code-代码里的坏味道"><a href="#【C1-Listening】Bad-Smells-in-Code-代码里的坏味道" class="headerlink" title="【C1-Listening】Bad Smells in Code-代码里的坏味道"></a>【C1-Listening】Bad Smells in Code-代码里的坏味道</h2><blockquote><p>Chapter 3: Bad Smells in Code<br>“If it stinks, change it.”</p><p>— Grandma Beck, discussing child raising philosophy By now you have a good idea of how refactoring works. But just because you know how doesn’t mean you know when. Deciding when to start refactoring (and when to stop) is just as important to refactoring as knowing how to operate the mechanics of a refactoring.</p><p>Now comes the dilemma. It is easy to explain to you how to delete an instance variable or create a hierarchy. These are simple matters. Trying to explain when you should do these things is not so cut-anddried. Rather than appealing to some vague notion of programming aesthetics (which frankly is what we consultants usually do) I wanted something a bit more solid.</p><p>I was mulling over this tricky issue when I visited Kent in Zurich. Perhaps he was under the influence of the odors of his new born daughter at the time, but he had come up with the notion describing the “when” of refactoring in terms of smells. “Smells,” you say, “and that is supposed to be better than vague aesthetics?” Well, yes. We look at lots of code, written by projects that span the gamut from wildly successful to nearly dead. And in doing so, we have learned to look for certain structures in the code that suggest (sometimes they scream for) the possibility of refactoring. (We are switching over to “we” in this chapter to reflect the fact that Kent and I wrote this chapter jointly. You can tell the difference because the funny jokes are mine and the others are his.)</p><p>One thing we won’t try to do here is give you precise criteria for when a refactoring is overdue. In our experience there is no set of metrics that rival informed human intuition. What we will do is give you indications that there is trouble that could be solved by a refactoring. You will have to develop your own sense of how many instance variables is too many instance variables and how many lines of code in a method is too many lines.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Duplicated-code"><a href="#Duplicated-code" class="headerlink" title="Duplicated code"></a>Duplicated code</h3><blockquote><p>Number one on the stink parade is duplicated code. If you see the same code structure in more than one place, you can be sure that your program will be better if you find a way to unify them.</p><p>The simplest duplicated code problem is when you have the same expression in two methods of the same class. Then all you have to do is Extract Method (114) and invoke the code from both places.</p><p>Another common duplication problem is when you have the same expression in two sibling subclasses. You can eliminate this duplication by using Extract Method (114) in both classes, then Pull Up Method (271). If the code is similar but not the same, then you need to use Extract Method (114) to separate the similar bits from the different bits.</p><p>You may then find you can use Form Template Method (289). If the methods do the same thing using a different algorithm, you can choose the clearer of the two algorithms and use Substitute Algorithm (132).</p><p>If you have duplicated code in two unrelated classes, consider using Extract Component (166) in one class, and then use the new component in the other. Another possibility is that the method really belongs only in one of the classes and should be invoked by the other class, or that the method belongs in a third class that should be referred to by both of the original classes. You have to decide where the method makes sense, and ensure it is there and nowhere else.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Long-method"><a href="#Long-method" class="headerlink" title="Long method"></a>Long method</h3><blockquote><p>The object programs that live best and longest are those with short methods. Programmers new to objects often get the feeling that no computation ever takes place, that object programs are endless sequences of delegation. When you have lived with a program for a few years, however, you learn just how valuable all those little methods are. All of the pay-offs of indirection- explanation, sharing, and choosing- are supported by little methods.</p><p>Since the early days of programming people have realized that the longer a procedure is, the more difficult it is to understand. Older languages carried an overhead in subroutine calls, which deterred people from small method, modern OO languages have pretty much eliminated that overhead. There is still an overhead to the reader of the code as you have to switch context to look and see what the sub-procedure does. Development environments that allow you to see two methods at once help to eliminate this; but the real key to making it easy to understand small methods is good naming. If you have a good name for a method you don’t need to look at the body.</p><p>The net effect of this is that you should be much more aggressive about decomposing methods. A heuristic we follow is whenever we feel the need to comment something, we instead write a method. Such a method contains the code that was commented, but is named after what the intention of the code is, rather than how it does it. We may do this on a group of lines, or on as small as a single line of code. We will do this even if the method call is longer than the code it replaces, providing the method name explains the purpose of the code. The key here is not the method length, but the semantic distance between what the method does and how it does it.</p><p>99% of the time, all you have to shorten a method is Extract Method (114). Find a part of the method that seems to go nicely together and make a new method.</p><p>If you have a method with lots of parameters and temporary variables, they get in the way of extracting methods. If you try to use Extract Method, you end up passing so many of the parameters and temporary variables as parameters to the extracted method that the result is scarcely more readable than the original. You can often use Inline Temp (121) to get rid of the temps. Long lists of parameters can be slimmed down with Introduce Parameter Object (247) and Preserve Whole Object (241).</p><p>If you’ve tried that, and you still have too many temps and parameters,<br>then it’s time to get out the heavy artillery: Replace Method with Method Object (130).</p><p>How do you identify the clumps of code to extract? A good technique is to look for comments. They often signal this kind of semantic distance.</p><p>A block of code with a comment that tells you what it is doing can be replaced by a method whose name is based on the comment.</p><p>Even a single line is worth extracting if it needs explanation.</p><p>Conditionals and loops also give signs for extractions. Use Decompose Conditional (136) to deal with conditional expressions. With loops extract the loop and the code within the loop into its own method.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Large-Class"><a href="#Large-Class" class="headerlink" title="Large Class"></a>Large Class</h3><blockquote><p>When a class is trying to do too much, it often shows up as too many instance variables. When a class has too many instance variables, duplicated code cannot be far behind.</p><p>You can Extract Component (166) to bundle up a number of the variables.</p><p>Choose variables to go together in the component that makes sense with each other. For example, “depositAmount” and “deposit-Currency” are likely to belong together in a component. More generally, common prefixes or suffixes for some subset of the variables in a class suggest the opportunity for a component. If the component makes sense as a subclass you’ll find Extract Subclass (277) often is easier.</p><p>However you can only do this if the subset of instance variables that are used do not change during an object’s lifetime.</p><p>Sometimes a class will not be using all of its instance variables all of the time. If so, you may be able to Extract Component (166) or Extract Subclass (277) many times.</p><p>As with a class with too many instance variables, a class with too much code is prime breeding ground for duplicated code, chaos, and death.</p><p>The simplest solution (have we mentioned that we like simple solutions?)</p><p>is if you can eliminate redundancy in the class itself. If you have five hundred line methods with lots of code in common, you may be able to turn them into five ten line methods with another ten two line methods extracted from the original.</p><p>As with a class with a huge wad of variables, the usual solution for a class with too much code is either to Extract Component (166) or Extract Subclass (277).</p></blockquote><h3 id="Long-Parameter-List"><a href="#Long-Parameter-List" class="headerlink" title="Long Parameter List"></a>Long Parameter List</h3><blockquote><p>In our early programming days we were taught to pass everything a routine needed in as parameters. This was understandable because the alternative was global data, and global data is evil and usually painful.</p><p>Objects change this situation because if you don’t have something you need, you can always ask another object to get it for you. Thus with objects you don’t pass in everything the method needs, instead you pass enough so that the method can get to everything it needs. A lot of what a method needs is available on method’s host class. Thus in object-oriented programs parameter lists tend to be much smaller than on traditional programs.</p><p>This is good because long parameter lists are hard to understand, they get inconsistent and difficult to use, and because you are forever changing them as you need more data. Most changes are removed by passing objects because you are much more likely to just need to make a couple of requests to get at a new piece of data.</p><p>Use Replace Parameter with Method (245) when you can get the data in one parameter by making a request of an object you already know about. This object might be a field or it might be another parameter.</p><p>Use Preserve Whole Object (241) to take a bunch of data gleaned from an object and replace it with the object itself. If you have several data items with no logical object, then Introduce Parameter Object (247).</p><p>There is one important exception to doing these changes. This is when you explicitly do not wish to create a dependency from the called object to the larger object. In those cases unpacking data and sending it along as parameters is reasonable, but pay attention to the pain involved. If the parameter list is too long or changes too often you will need to rethink your dependency structure.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Divergent-Change"><a href="#Divergent-Change" class="headerlink" title="Divergent Change"></a>Divergent Change</h3><blockquote><p>We structure our software to make change easier, after all software is meant to be soft. So when we make a change we want to be able to jump to a single clear point in the system and make the change.</p><p>If you look at a class and say, “Well, I will have to change these three methods every time I get a new database. I have to change these four methods every time there is a new financial instrument.” you likely have a situation where two objects are better than one. Of course you often discover this only after you’ve added a few databases or financial instruments. Any change to handle a variation should change a single class and all the typing in the new class should be expressing the variation.</p><p>So for this you identify those things you are changing and use Extract Component (166) to put them all together.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Shotgun-Surgery"><a href="#Shotgun-Surgery" class="headerlink" title="Shotgun Surgery"></a>Shotgun Surgery</h3><blockquote><p>You whiff this when every time you add some variation, you have to make a lot of little changes to a lot of different classes. When the changes are all over the place, they are hard to find, and it’s easy to miss an important change. In this case you want to use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) to get all the changes into a single class. If no current class looks like a good candidate, then create one. Often you can use Inline Component (170) to bring a whole bunch of behavior together. You then get a small dose of Divergent Change, but you can easily deal with that.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Feature-Envy"><a href="#Feature-Envy" class="headerlink" title="Feature Envy"></a>Feature Envy</h3><blockquote><p>The whole point of objects is that they are a packaging technique that packages data together with the processes upon that data. A classic smell is thus a method that seems more interested in another class than the one it’s actually in. The most common focus of the envy is the data.</p><p>We’ve lost count of the times we’ve seen a method that invokes half-adozen getting methods on another object in order to calculate some value. Fortunately the cure is obvious, the method clearly wants to be elsewhere so you use Move Method (160) to get it there. Sometimes only part of the method suffers from envy, in that case use Extract Method (114) on the jealous bit and then Move Method (160) to give it a dream home.</p><p>Of course not all cases are so cut and dried. Often a method uses features of several classes, so which one should it live with? The heuristic we use is to which class has most of the data and put the method with that data. This is often made easier by using Extract Method (114) to break into methods that go into different places.</p><p>Of course there several sophisticated patterns that break this rule.</p><p>From the [Gang of Four] Strategy and Visitor immediately leap to mind. Kent’s Self Delegation is another. You do these to combat the Divergent Change smell. The fundamental rule of thumb is to put things together that change together. Data and the behavior that references that data usually change together, but there are exceptions.</p><p>When those exceptions occur we move the behavior to keep changes in one place. Strategy and Visitor allow you to change behavior easily because it isolates the small amount of behavior that needs to be overridden, at the cost of further indirection.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Data-Clumps"><a href="#Data-Clumps" class="headerlink" title="Data Clumps"></a>Data Clumps</h3><blockquote><p>Data items tend to be like children — they enjoy hanging around in groups together. Often you’ll see the same three or four data items together in lots of places: fields in a couple of classes, parameters in many method signatures. Bunches of data that hang around together really ought to be made into their own object. The first step is to look for where they appear as fields. Use Extract Component (166) on the fields to turn them into an object. Then turn your attention to method signatures, using Introduce Parameter Object (247) or Preserve Whole Object (241) to slim them down. The immediate benefit here is that you can shrink a lot of parameter lists and make method calling a lot simpler.</p><p>Don’t worry about data clumps that only use some of the fields of the new object. As long as you are replacing a couple or more fields with the new object, you’ll come out ahead.</p><p>A good test is to consider deleting one of the data values: if you did this would the others make any sense? If they don’t that’s a sure sign that you have an object that’s dying to be born.</p><p>Reducing field lists and parameter lists will certainly remove a few bad smells, but once you have the objects you get the opportunity to make a nice perfume. You can now look for cases of Divergent Change which will suggest behavior that can be moved into your new classes.</p><p>Before long these classes will be productive members of society.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Case-Statements"><a href="#Case-Statements" class="headerlink" title="Case Statements"></a>Case Statements</h3><blockquote><p>One of the most obvious symptoms of object-oriented code is its lack of case (or switch) statements. The problem with case statements is essentially that of duplication. Often you find the same case statement scattered about a program for different purposes. If you add a type to the case you have to find all these case statements and change them. The object-oriented notion of polymorphism gives you an elegant way to deal with this problem.</p><p>So most times you see a case statement you should think about polymorphism, the issue is where should the polymorphism occur. Usually case statement will switch on a type code. You will want the method on class that hosts the type code value.

The object-oriented notion of polymorphism gives you an elegant way to deal with this problem.<br>面向对象代码最明显的症状之一是缺少 case（或 switch）语句。 case 语句的问题本质上是重复。通常，您会发现出于不同目的，相同的 case 语句分散在程序中。如果向 case 添加类型，则必须找到所有这些 case 语句并更改它们。面向对象的多态性概念为您提供了一种处理此问题的优雅方法。</p><p>So most times you see a case statement you should think about polymorphism, the issue is where should the polymorphism occur. Usually case statement will switch on a type code. You will want the method on class that hosts the type code value. So use Extract Method (114) to extract the switch statement and then Move Method (160) to get it onto the class where the polymorphism is needed. At that point you have to decide whether to Replace Type Code with Subclasses (224) or Replace Type Code with State&#x2F;Strategy (227). When you have set up the inheritance structure you can then Replace Switch with Polymorphism (147).<br>所以大多数时候你看到一个case语句你应该考虑多态性，问题是多态性应该发生在哪里。通常 case 语句会打开类型代码。您将需要托管类型代码值的类上的方法。因此，使用 Extract Method (114) 提取 switch 语句，然后使用 Move Method (160) 将其放到需要多态性的类中。此时，您必须决定是用子类替换类型代码 (224) 还是用状态&#x2F;策略替换类型代码 (227)。设置继承结构后，您可以用多态性替换 Switch (147)。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Parallel-Inheritance-Hierarchies并行继承层次结构"><a href="#Parallel-Inheritance-Hierarchies并行继承层次结构" class="headerlink" title="Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies并行继承层次结构"></a>Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies并行继承层次结构</h3><blockquote><p>This smell is really a special case of “the same rate off change in two objects”. In this case, every time you make a subclass of one class you also have to make a subclass of another. You can recognize this smell because the prefixes of the class names in one hierarchy are the same as the prefixes in another hierarchy.<br>这种气味实际上是“两个物体变化率相同”的特例。在这种情况下，每次创建一个类的子类时，您还必须创建另一个类的子类。您可以识别出这种气味，因为一个层次结构中的类名前缀与另一个层次结构中的前缀相同。</p><p>The general strategy for eliminating the duplication is to make sure that instances of one hierarchy refer to instances of the other, then use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) the hierarchy disappears on the referring class.<br>消除重复的一般策略是确保一个层次结构的实例引用另一层次结构的实例，然后使用移动方法 (160) 和移动字段 (164)，层次结构在引用类上消失。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Lazy-Class懒惰类"><a href="#Lazy-Class懒惰类" class="headerlink" title="Lazy Class懒惰类"></a>Lazy Class懒惰类</h3><blockquote><p>Each class you create costs money. If there is a class that isn’t doing enough to pay for itself, it should be eliminated.<br>您创建的每个类都需要花钱。如果有一个阶级的努力不足以维持其自身的收入，那么它就应该被淘汰。</p><p>If you have subclasses that aren’t doing enough, try to use Collapse Hierarchy (288). Nearly useless components should be subjected to Inline Component (170).<br>如果您的子类做得不够，请尝试使用 Collapse Hierarchy (288)。几乎无用的组件应该受到内联组件（170）的影响。</p><p>Similar subclasses类似的子类<br>Sometimes you will see a class with four subclasses, each of which only implements three simple methods. Often you will get a vague feeling that the class doesn’t deserve subclasses, but you won’t immediately be able to see how to eliminate them. This feeling can last for months or even years. Don’t worry. If you keep nibbling away at the problems you can see how to solve, eventually you will find yourself looking at the subclasses again, and all the difficult issues to resolve will have disappeared.<br>有时你会看到一个类有四个子类，每个子类只实现三个简单的方法。通常你会隐约感觉到该类不值得有子类，但你不会立即知道如何消除它们。这种感觉可以持续数月甚至数年。不用担心。如果你不断地啃那些你能看到如何解决的问题，最终你会发现自己再次查看子类，所有需要解决的难题都将消失。</p><p>Once you’ve done this, look for new opportunities to use inheritance now that you are no longer wasting it.<br>完成此操作后，请寻找新的机会来使用继承，因为您不再浪费它了。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Temporary-Field临时字段"><a href="#Temporary-Field临时字段" class="headerlink" title="Temporary Field临时字段"></a>Temporary Field临时字段</h3><blockquote><p>Sometimes you will see an object where an instance variable is only set in certain circumstances. Such code is difficult to understand, because you expect an object to need all of its variables. Trying to understand why a variable is there when it doesn’t seem to be used can drive you nuts.<br>有时您会看到一个对象，其中的实例变量仅在某些情况下设置。这样的代码很难理解，因为您期望一个对象需要它的所有变量。试图理解一个似乎没有被使用的变量为什么会存在，这会让你发疯。</p><p>Use Extract Component (166) to create a home for the poor orphan variables. Put all the code that concerns the variables in the component.<br>使用提取组件 (166) 为可怜的孤儿变量创建一个家。将所有涉及变量的代码放在组件中。</p><p>You may also be able to eliminate conditional code by using Introduce Null Object (151) to create an alternative component for when the variables aren’t valid.<br>您还可以通过使用引入空对象 (151) 来消除条件代码，以便在变量无效时创建替代组件。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Middle-Man中间人"><a href="#Middle-Man中间人" class="headerlink" title="Middle Man中间人"></a>Middle Man中间人</h3><blockquote><p>One of the prime features of objects is encapsulation: hiding internal details from the rest of the world. Often this encapsulation comes with delegation, you ask a director if she is free a meeting, she delegates the message to her diary, and gives you an answer. All well and good,there is no need to know whether the director uses a diary, an electronic gizmo, or a secretary to keep track of her appointments.<br>对象的主要特征之一是封装：向外界隐藏内部细节。通常这种封装伴随着授权，你问一位主管她是否有空开会，她将信息委托给她的日记，然后给你一个答案。一切都很好，没有必要知道主任是否使用日记、电子小玩意或秘书来记录她的约会。</p><p>However this can go too far (particularly with those who take the Law of Demeter too seriously). You look at a class’s interface and find half the methods are delegating to this other class. After a while it’s time to cut out the middle man and talk to the object that really knows what’s going on. Use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) to move features out of the middle man into the other objects until the middle man has nothing left.<br>然而，这可能太过分了（特别是对于那些过于认真对待德墨忒尔定律的人）。您查看一个类的接口，发现一半的方法委托给了另一个类。过了一会儿，就可以去掉中间人，与真正知道发生了什么的对象进行对话。使用移动方法 (160) 和移动字段 (164) 将特征从中间人移到其他对象中，直到中间人没有任何剩余。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Alternative-classes-with-different-interfaces具有不同接口的替代类"><a href="#Alternative-classes-with-different-interfaces具有不同接口的替代类" class="headerlink" title="Alternative classes with different interfaces具有不同接口的替代类"></a>Alternative classes with different interfaces具有不同接口的替代类</h3><blockquote><p>Use Rename Method (234) on any methods that do the same thing but have different signatures for what they do. Often this doesn’t go far enough. In these cases the classes aren’t doing enough yet. Keep using Move Method (160) to move behavior to them until the protocols are the same. If you have to redundantly move code to accomplish this, you may be able to use Extract Superclass (282) to atone.<br>对执行相同操作但具有不同功能签名的任何方法使用重命名方法 (234)。通常这还不够。在这些情况下，班级做得还不够。继续使用移动方法 (160) 将行为移动到它们，直到协议相同。如果您必须冗余地移动代码来完成此操作，您可以使用 Extract Superclass (282) 来弥补。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Comments注释"><a href="#Comments注释" class="headerlink" title="Comments注释"></a>Comments注释</h3><blockquote><p>Don’t worry, we aren’t saying that people shouldn’t write comments.<br>别担心，我们并不是说人们不应该写注释。</p><p>In our olfactory analogy, comments aren’t a bad smell, indeed they are a sweet smell.<br>在我们的嗅觉比喻中，注释并不是难闻的气味，实际上它们是一种甜蜜的气味。</p><p>The reason we mention them here is because comments are often used as a deodorant. It’s surprising how often you look at thickly commented code, and notice that the comments are there because the code is bad.<br>我们在这里提到它们的原因是因为注释经常被用作除臭剂。令人惊讶的是，当您查看大量注释的代码时，您会发现注释的存在是因为代码很糟糕。</p><p>Thus comments lead us to bad code that has all the rotten whiffs we’ve discussed in the rest of this chapter. Our first action to remove the bad smells by refactoring. When we’re done we often find that the comments are now superfluous.<br>因此，注释会导致我们编写出糟糕的代码，其中包含我们在本章其余部分讨论的所有腐烂的味道。我们的第一个行动是通过重构来消除不良气味。当我们完成后，我们经常发现注释现在是多余的。</p><p>When you feel the need to write a comment, try first to refactor the code so that any comment would be superfluous.<br>当您觉得需要编写注释时，请首先尝试重构代码，以便任何注释都是多余的。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Employees who manage their time well are more productive, more efficient, and more likely to meet deadlines. They focus on the most important and time-sensitive tasks and limit the amount of time wasted on non-essential duties. 什么是时间管理技能，为什么它们在工作场所很重要？管理好时间的员工生产力更高、效率更高，并且更有可能按时完成工作。他们专注于最重要和时间敏感的任务，并限制浪费在非必要职责上的时间。</p><p>Time management skills, like other <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-are-soft-skills-2060852">soft skills</a>, such as <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/organizational-skills-list-2063762">organizational skills</a>, are in high demand. Employers will be assessing your ability to manage your time, and the effectiveness of your team to reach department objectives.时间管理技能与其他软技能（例如组织技能）一样，需求量很大。雇主将评估您管理时间的能力以及您的团队实现部门目标的有效性。</p><p>Learn about time management skills, understand why they are valuable in the workplace, review the different types of time management skills, and see examples of how they are used on the job.了解时间管理技能，了解它们为何在工作场所有价值，回顾不同类型的时间管理技能，并查看如何在工作中使用它们的示例。</p><h3 id="What-Are-Time-Management-Skills-什么是时间管理技能？"><a href="#What-Are-Time-Management-Skills-什么是时间管理技能？" class="headerlink" title="What Are Time Management Skills? 什么是时间管理技能？"></a>What Are Time Management Skills? 什么是时间管理技能？</h3><p>Time management involves both managing your own time and the time of the others. Time management means working efficiently, and employers in every industry look for staff that can make optimal use of the time available to them on the job. Saving time saves the organization money and increases revenue.时间管理包括管理自己的时间和他人的时间。时间管理意味着高效工作，每个行业的雇主都在寻找能够充分利用工作时间的员工。节省时间可以为组织节省资金并增加收入。</p><p>Effective time management requires staff to analyze their workload, assign priorities, and maintain focus on productive endeavors. 有效的时间管理要求员工分析他们的工作量、分配优先级并保持对富有成效的努力的关注。</p><blockquote><h4 id="Note笔记"><a href="#Note笔记" class="headerlink" title="Note笔记"></a>Note笔记</h4><p>Employees who are excellent time managers can eliminate distractions and enlist support from colleagues to help accomplish their goals.优秀的时间管理者可以消除干扰并获得同事的支持来帮助实现他们的目标。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Types-of-Time-Management-Skills-时间管理技能的类型"><a href="#Types-of-Time-Management-Skills-时间管理技能的类型" class="headerlink" title="Types of Time Management Skills 时间管理技能的类型"></a>Types of Time Management Skills 时间管理技能的类型</h3><img src="/2024/03/25/b1-writing-13-time-management/time-management-skills-2063776-v6-5b749ddfc9e77c0057e72c0f.png" class="" title="Time Management Skills"><h3 id="Prioritizing-确定优先顺序"><a href="#Prioritizing-确定优先顺序" class="headerlink" title="Prioritizing 确定优先顺序"></a>Prioritizing 确定优先顺序</h3><p>It might be impossible to do every single minute task expected of you. You also might want to do everything all at once. But you must prioritize so that you are able to complete the most important tasks in an order that makes sense. When assigning priority, consider such factors as when each task needs to be done, how long it might take, how important it might be to others in the organization, what could happen if a task is not done, and whether any task might be interrupted by bottlenecks in the process.完成您期望的每分钟任务可能是不可能的。您可能还想一次性完成所有事情。但您必须确定优先顺序，以便能够按合理的顺序完成最重要的任务。分配优先级时，请考虑以下因素：每项任务需要何时完成、可能需要多长时间、它对组织中其他人的重要性、如果任务未完成会发生什么以及是否有任何任务可能被中断过程中遇到瓶颈。</p><ul><li>Allocation分配</li><li>Managing Expectations管理期望</li><li>Waste Prevention废物预防</li><li>Prioritizing requests and demands优先考虑请求和要求</li><li>High-Value Activities (HVAs)高价值活动 (HVA)</li><li>Performance Reviews绩效评估</li><li>Goal Setting目标设定</li></ul><h3 id="Scheduling-日程安排"><a href="#Scheduling-日程安排" class="headerlink" title="Scheduling 日程安排"></a>Scheduling 日程安排</h3><p>Scheduling is important because some tasks have to be done at specific times. Scheduling affects your day, your week, your month, as well as other people’s workflow. Most have specific times of the day when they are more or less productive as a result of energy levels and demands of the day. Schedules can be a good way to avoid <strong>procrastination</strong>, too.日程安排很重要，因为有些任务必须在特定时间完成。日程安排会影响你的一天、一周、一个月以及其他人的工作流程。大多数人在一天中都有特定的时间，根据当天的精力水平和需求，他们的工作效率会有所不同。时间表也是避免拖延的好方法。</p><ul><li>Scheduling Software调度软件</li><li>Intentionality意向性</li><li>Punctuality准时</li><li>Breaking broader goals into milestones将更广泛的目标分解为里程碑</li><li>Breaking up milestones into projects将里程碑分解为项目</li></ul><h3 id="Task-Management-任务管理"><a href="#Task-Management-任务管理" class="headerlink" title="Task Management 任务管理"></a>Task Management 任务管理</h3><p>To-do lists (properly prioritized and integrated with your schedule) are a great way to avoid forgetting something important. They are also a great way to avoid spending all day thinking about everything you have to do. Remembering tasks takes energy and thinking about everything you have to do all week can be exhausting and overwhelming. Split all the necessary tasks up into a list for each day, and you won’t have to worry about all of it all at once. Just take your tasks one day at a time.待办事项列表（正确排列优先顺序并与您的日程安排相结合）是避免忘记重要事情的好方法。它们也是避免花一整天时间思考你必须做的一切的好方法。记住任务需要精力，而思考整个星期必须做的所有事情可能会让人筋疲力尽、不知所措。将每天所有必要的任务分成一个列表，您就不必一次担心所有事情。一天一次地完成你的任务。</p><ul><li>Proactive积极主动的</li><li>Batching配料</li><li>Creating daily, weekly, and monthly to do lists创建每日、每周和每月的待办事项列表</li><li><a href="https://www.liveabout.com/multitasking-skills-with-examples-2059692">Multitasking多任务处理</a></li><li>Thoroughness彻底性</li><li>Organization组织</li><li>Email Management电子邮件管理</li></ul><h3 id="Workload-Management-工作负载管理"><a href="#Workload-Management-工作负载管理" class="headerlink" title="Workload Management 工作负载管理"></a>Workload Management 工作负载管理</h3><p>Pacing your work, even though it may seem an odd thing to call a skill, is an important time management concept. Although working long hours or skipping breaks can sometimes improve productivity in the short term, your exhaustion later will ensure that your overall productivity actually drops. Except for rare emergencies, it is important to resist the <strong>temptation</strong> to over work. Include necessary breaks, and a <strong>sensible</strong> quitting time, in your schedule.尽管将工作节奏称为技能似乎有些奇怪，但它是一个重要的时间管理概念。尽管长时间工作或不休息有时可以在短期内提高生产力，但随后的疲惫将确保您的整体生产力实际上下降。除了罕见的紧急情况外，抵制过度工作的诱惑很重要。在你的日程安排中包括必要的休息和合理的休息时间。</p><p>Knowing and enforcing an optimum workload for yourself ensures consistency in your performance and avoids <strong>burnout</strong>. Employers want to be able to count on you for the long-term.了解并执行适合自己的最佳工作量可确保您的表现保持一致并避免倦怠。雇主希望能够长期信赖您。</p><ul><li>Process Management流程管理</li><li>Assertiveness自信</li><li>Eliminating Waste消除浪费</li><li>Taking Breaks休息一下</li></ul><h3 id="Delegation-委派"><a href="#Delegation-委派" class="headerlink" title="Delegation 委派"></a>Delegation 委派</h3><p>Depending on what type of work you do, you may be able to <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/delegation-skills-2059688">delegate some tasks</a>. Knowing what and when to delegate is an important skill. Some people resist delegating, either because they want to maintain control or because they want to save money by not hiring assistants. Both <strong>approaches</strong> ultimately hurt productivity and raise costs.根据您从事的工作类型，您也许可以委派一些任务。知道委派什么以及何时委派是一项重要技能。有些人拒绝授权，要么是因为他们想保持控制权，要么是因为他们想通过不雇用助理来省钱。这两种方法最终都会损害生产力并提高成本。</p><p>Remember, however, that if you practice time management diligently and still can’t get everything done, you may be trying to do too much. It is better to succeed at a few tasks than to attempt and fail at many.但请记住，如果您努力进行时间管理，但仍然无法完成所有事情，那么您可能尝试做的事情太多了。在一些任务上取得成功比在许多任务上尝试并失败要好。</p><ul><li>Seeking Expert Assistance寻求专家帮助</li><li>Moderating Meetings主持会议</li><li>Presentation推介会</li><li>Teamwork团队合作</li><li>Leadership领导</li><li>Collaboration合作</li><li>Motivation动机</li></ul><h3 id="More-Time-Management-Skills-更多时间管理技巧"><a href="#More-Time-Management-Skills-更多时间管理技巧" class="headerlink" title="More Time Management Skills 更多时间管理技巧"></a>More Time Management Skills 更多时间管理技巧</h3><p>Here are more time management for resumes, cover letters, job applications, and interviews.

Then I read them next 1 January and see how well I did!我喜欢每年以新年决心开始。然后我在明年 1 月 1 日读了它们，看看我做得有多好！</p><p>Here are my resolutions this year.这是我今年的决心。</p><p><strong>1. Get fit!!1. 健身！！</strong></p><p>I say this every year but I hope writing it in public will make it more real. I’m aiming for three runs a week – I think I can do it! I think a fitness tracking app might help me achieve it. Or I could find a running partner. If anyone who’s reading this wants to be my partner, let me know!我每年都会这么说，但我希望公开写出来会让它更加真实。我的目标是每周跑步三次——我想我能做到！我认为健身追踪应用程序可能会帮助我实现这一目标。或者我可以找到一个跑步伙伴。如果阅读本文的任何人想成为我的合作伙伴，请告诉我！</p><p><strong>2. Save 10 per cent of my salary a month2. 每月存下工资的 10%</strong></p><p>Having no savings is starting to worry me and 10 per cent is realistic. It’s not too much, but it’s not too little that I won’t see it add up. I’ll put the money into a special bank account that will make it grow … Actually, I don’t know much about that so maybe my next resolution should be to find out how to invest money!!没有积蓄让我开始担心，10% 是现实的。不算太多，但也不算太少，以至于我看不到它加起来。我会把钱存入一个特殊的银行账户，让它增值……实际上，我对此了解不多，所以也许我的下一个决心应该是找出如何投资钱！</p><p><strong>3. Cook more3.多煮点</strong></p><p>I’d like to start inviting friends for dinner and cooking for them. I think once a month is a good plan. By the end of the year I want to have five dishes I can cook really well so people will say, ‘Have you ever had Darren’s delicious cooking?’ Who wants to be my first guest?我想开始邀请朋友吃饭并为他们做饭。我认为每月一次是一个不错的计划。到今年年底，我希望能做出五道菜，我可以做得非常好，这样人们就会说，“你吃过达伦做的美味佳肴吗？”谁想成为我的第一位客人？</p></blockquote><h3 id="Tips-小贴士"><a href="#Tips-小贴士" class="headerlink" title="Tips-小贴士"></a>Tips-小贴士</h3><blockquote><ol><li>Before you start a writing task, make a plan.

The authorities found Guy Fawkes in the room guarding the explosives, and he was sentenced to torture and death.篝火之夜最棒的就是烟花，哦，还有篝火！ ……以及其背后的历史。基本上，盖伊·福克斯和他的朋友们试图炸毁议会大厦并杀死国王詹姆斯一世。他们也几乎做到了——他们在议会大厦下面租了一个房间，并在里面装满了炸药。但有人告诉了王宫。当局发现盖伊·福克斯在房间里看守炸药，他被判处酷刑和死刑。</p><p>So it’s a tradition that celebrates the fact that the king survived.

Pretty dark and horrible when you think about it!所以这是一个庆祝国王幸存的传统。这也意味着人们不会忘记如果你密谋反对你的国家会发生什么。有一首关于它的诗，开头是“记住，记住十一月五日，火药，叛国和阴谋。”这就是为什么我们建造一个“盖伊”——真人大小的盖伊·福克斯模型——并将其放在篝火上烧掉。当你想到它时，非常黑暗和可怕！</p></blockquote><h3 id="Tips-小贴士"><a href="#Tips-小贴士" class="headerlink" title="Tips-小贴士"></a>Tips-小贴士</h3><blockquote><ol><li><p>It’s nice to start by saying something that shows you have read other people’s posts.<br> 最好先说一些表明您已经阅读过其他人的帖子的内容。</p></li><li><p>In a class forum you can be quite informal.<br> 在课堂论坛上，你可以非常随意。</p></li><li><p>In informal writing you can sometimes miss out the beginning of a phrase:<br> 在非正式写作中，您有时可能会错过短语的开头：</p><p> So cool to read about everyone’s home tradition …<br> 读到每个人的家庭传统真是太酷了……</p></li><li><p>Remember, in a forum you are part of a long conversation with a lot of other people so they might ask you questions.<br>请记住，在论坛中，您是与许多其他人进行长时间对话的一部分，因此他们可能会问您问题。</p></li></ol></blockquote><h3 id="Task-1-任务一"><a href="#Task-1-任务一" class="headerlink" title="Task 1-任务一"></a>Task 1-任务一</h3><h4 id="A-class-forum-–-1"><a href="#A-class-forum-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A class forum – 1"></a>A class forum – 1</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The writer is American.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Bonfire Night is celebrated in autumn in the UK.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Guy Fawkes wanted to blow up the royal palace.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Guy Fawkes’s plan worked.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Bonfire Night is a warning as well as a celebration.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Guy Fawkes wanted people to remember him on 5 November.<br>True<br>False</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The writer is American.<br>True<br>✔False</li><li>Bonfire Night is celebrated in autumn in the UK.<br>✔True<br>False</li><li>Guy Fawkes wanted to blow up the royal palace.<br>True<br>✔False</li><li>Guy Fawkes’s plan worked.<br>True<br>✔False</li><li>Bonfire Night is a warning as well as a celebration.<br>✔True<br>False</li><li>Guy Fawkes wanted people to remember him on 5 November.<br>True<br>✔False</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-writing-01-class-forum/image-20240424143544719.png" alt="image-20240424143544719"></p><h3 id="Task-2-任务二"><a href="#Task-2-任务二" class="headerlink" title="Task 2-任务二"></a>Task 2-任务二</h3><h4 id="A-class-forum-–-2"><a href="#A-class-forum-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A class forum – 2"></a>A class forum – 2</h4><p>Choose the best answer.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>What is the purpose of the first sentence in this post?<br>a.

I’m from England but I’ve been living in the States for five years and the thing I miss the most is Bonfire Night on November 5th.读到每个人最怀念的家乡传统真是太酷了！我来自英国，但我在美国生活了五年，我最怀念的是11月5日的篝火之夜。</p><p>The best thing about Bonfire Night is the fireworks, oh, and the bonfires! … and the history behind it.

Thanks for coming in for the interview.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: It’s my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Well, as you know, the company has been expanding and we have an opening in our HR department. We’re creating a new role for someone to lead our training and development within the company.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, I very much think that my skills and experience are a good fit for what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That sounds great. So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you’ve been doing over the past four years or so.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider which offered HR services, including L&amp;D, to corporate clients.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: OK, so it was only B2B?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, that’s right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, I very much like the L&amp;D side of my role and I’ve always had particularly good feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I’m looking to specialise, and as your company has around 2,000 people, right …? </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yes, that’s right.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&amp;D. I’m also a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&amp;D qualification.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we’re looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won’t be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role.  </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yes, that would be a good thing.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Also, I’m used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Um, I think we’ve covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick questions though.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Go on.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Well, there’s the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team, which currently has six people in it. There’s usually an intern or two who you can get some support from also.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: OK. Thanks. That’s all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this role will be measured. What does success look like?</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That’s a good question. As you know, we have a performance management system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs within the organisation. But we haven’t devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and then successfully implement this strategy.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Thank you. That sounds interesting.  </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We’ll be discussing all candidates next week and then I’ll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Thank you for your time. I’d welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>Interviewer: Hello, Maria. Thanks for coming in for the interview.<br>面试官：你好，玛丽亚。感谢您接受面试。</p><p>Maria: It’s my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.<br>玛丽亚：这是我的荣幸。谢谢你邀请我。</p><p>Interviewer: Well, as you know, the company has been expanding and we have an opening in our HR department. We’re creating a new role for someone to lead our training and development within the company.<br>面试官：嗯，如您所知，公司一直在扩张，我们的人力资源部门有一个空缺。我们正在为某人设立一个新角色来领导公司内部的培训和发展。</p><p>Maria: Yes, I very much think that my skills and experience are a good fit for what you’re looking for.<br>玛丽亚：是的，我非常认为我的技能和经验非常适合您正在寻找的东西。</p><p>Interviewer: That sounds great. So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you’ve been doing over the past four years or so.<br>面试官：听起来很棒。所以，你的简历看起来很不错，不过如果你能用你自己的话向我们概述一下你在过去四年左右的时间里所做的事情，那就更好了。</p><p>Maria: Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider which offered HR services, including L&amp;D, to corporate clients.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，四年前，在我的第一份工作中，我为一家小型人力资源服务提供商工作，该提供商为企业客户提供包括学习与发展在内的人力资源服务。</p><p>Interviewer: OK, so it was only B2B?<br>面试官：好的，所以这只是 B2B？</p><p>Maria: Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C.<br>Maria：是的，我们只向其他公司提供服务，而不是 B2C。</p><p>Interviewer: Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago.<br>面试官：是的，上面写着你大约三年前离开了那家公司。</p><p>Maria: Yes, that’s right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development.<br>玛丽亚：是的，没错。我寻求更多的稳定性，并成为更大组织的一部分。因此，我加入了一家拥有大约一百名员工和一个小型人力资源团队的公司。由于我们只有几个人，所以我们每个人都处理一系列人力资源主题。除了工资之外，我负责的领域之一是学习和发展。</p><p>Interviewer: I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now?<br>面试官：我明白了。那么，你为什么现在想换工作呢？</p><p>Maria: Well, I very much like the L&amp;D side of my role and I’ve always had particularly good feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I’m looking to specialise, and as your company has around 2,000 people, right …?<br>玛丽亚：嗯，我非常喜欢我的角色中的学习与发展方面，并且我在该领域的工作一直得到特别好的反馈。我相信我在该领域表现出色。所以，我希望专业化，而贵公司大约有 2,000 名员工，对吧……？</p><p>Interviewer: Yes, that’s right.<br>面试官：是的，没错。</p><p>Maria: Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&amp;D. I’m also a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，这种规模的组织将为我提供专门从事学习与发展的空间。我也是您品牌的忠实追随者，并且感觉与您的形象和价值观完全一致。</p><p>Interviewer: Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&amp;D qualification.<br>面试官：嗯，听起来不错。我可以看到你有 L&amp;D 证书。</p><p>Maria: Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management.<br>玛丽亚：是的，我两年前获得了文凭。我目前还在攻读心理学进一步文凭，特别关注学习和绩效管理。</p><p>Interviewer: Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we’re looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company?<br>面试官：非常好。嗯，看来您具备我们正在寻找的资质和经验。您认为加入一家更大的公司将面临哪些主要挑战？</p><p>Maria: I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won’t be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role.<br>玛丽亚：我可以看到，在如此规模的组织中没有经验可能会被视为一种弱点，而我认为这也可能是一种优势。我不会给这个角色带来太多先入为主、可能不灵活的想法。</p><p>Interviewer: Yes, that would be a good thing.<br>面试官：是的，那将是一件好事。</p><p>Maria: Also, I’m used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale.<br>玛丽亚：此外，我习惯于采取非常个人化的方法来进行员工发展。我意识到，这种拥有 2,000 名员工的方法必须以不同的方式进行，但我带来了许多可以在更大范围内复制的想法。</p><p>Interviewer: I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me?<br>面试官：我明白你的意思。好的，那么，您有什么问题要问我吗？</p><p>Maria: Um, I think we’ve covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick questions though.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，我认为我们已经涵盖了我想要解决的许多领域。不过我有两个简单的问题。</p><p>Interviewer: Go on.<br>面试官：继续。</p><p>Maria: Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?<br>玛丽亚：我每天主要和谁一起工作？</p><p>Interviewer: Well, there’s the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team, which currently has six people in it. There’s usually an intern or two who you can get some support from also.<br>面试官：嗯，您要向人力资源经理汇报。然后是人力资源团队，目前有六人。通常还有一两个实习生，你也可以从他们那里得到一些支持。</p><p>Maria: OK. Thanks. That’s all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this role will be measured. What does success look like?<br>玛丽亚：好的。谢谢。这一切都很清楚。我的另一个问题是如何衡量这个角色的表现。成功是什么样的？</p><p>Interviewer: That’s a good question. As you know, we have a performance management system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs within the organisation. But we haven’t devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and then successfully implement this strategy.<br>面试官：这是个好问题。如您所知，我们有一个绩效管理系统，从中我们确定了组织内的一些学习和发展需求。但我们还没有制定策略。您的角色是制定并成功实施该策略。</p><p>Maria: Thank you. That sounds interesting.<br>玛丽亚：谢谢。听起来很有趣。</p><p>Interviewer: Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We’ll be discussing all candidates next week and then I’ll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome.<br>面试官：太好了。再次感谢您今天的光临。我们将在下周讨论所有候选人，然后我会在下周末之前回复您，让您知道结果。</p><p>Maria: Thank you for your time. I’d welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.<br>玛丽亚：谢谢您的宝贵时间。我很高兴有机会与您继续讨论这个角色。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-job-interview-–-1"><a href="#A-job-interview-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A job interview – 1"></a>A job interview – 1</h4><p>Choose the correct answers.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>Four years ago, Maria worked for a small HR services provider …<br>a. in the B2B sector.<br>b. in the B2C sector.<br>c. in both B2B and B2C sectors.</li><li>Maria has been in her current job …<br>a. for four years.<br>b. for three years.<br>c. for one year.</li><li>Maria’s current role is focused …<br>a. only on learning and development.<br>b. on a number of HR topics.<br>c. only on payroll and she wants to do L&amp;D.</li><li>Maria …<br>a. did a diploma in L&amp;D two years ago.<br>b. is doing a diploma in psychology at the moment.<br>c.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question. Or, for example, ‘And which office is that again?’ Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I get you …</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>Presenter: So, today’s expert teacher is Gabriella, a university English teacher from Leeds. Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.<br>主持人：今天的专家老师是来自利兹的大学英语老师 Gabriella。加布里埃拉，您好，感谢您今天加入我们。</p><p>Gabriella: Thanks for having me!<br>加布里埃拉：谢谢你邀请我！</p><p>Presenter: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account.

Or, for example, ‘And which office is that again?’ Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question.

Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter.

However, we’ll waste too much time if we wait until everything is planned before we actually start working on the project.

I think we should take an agile approach.<br>贾尼：在这一点上我同意你的观点，大卫。然而，如果等到一切都计划好之后才真正开始项目，我们会浪费太多时间。我认为我们应该采取敏捷的方法。</p><p><strong>David</strong>: Agile approach?<br>大卫：敏捷方法？</p><p><strong>Jani</strong>: Well, it means that we start quickly and then adapt as we go along.<br>Jani：嗯，这意味着我们要快速开始，然后随着进展而适应。</p><p><strong>Emiko</strong>: That’s right.<br>惠美子：没错。</p><p><strong>Jani</strong>: Carolina, you’ve been very quiet.<br>贾尼：卡罗琳娜，你一直很安静。</p><p><strong>Carolina</strong>: Um … I’m sorry.

We need to be flexible, and we also need to move quickly.<br>卡罗莱纳：对不起，大卫。我不认为我同意你的观点。有一个好的计划很重要。但计划可能会改变，即使是好的计划——而且业务也经常发生变化。我们需要灵活，也需要快速行动。</p><p><strong>Jani</strong>: OK.

As if I would miss that!</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: And?</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: It was by far the best episode, definitely.</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: Yeah, totally. The dragon at the end and all the special effects in that final scene were amazing.</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: I loved that part! But I still don’t think this series was as good as the others.</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: Really? But you said you wouldn’t want to miss it?</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: I know, but still … it’s a lot more predictable than it used to be.</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: But that’s because the story has been told so well that all the characters are reaching their destiny now.</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: I don’t know … before, anyone could die at any time so it was exciting! But, this series, no key characters died and we all knew they wouldn’t. When Jaime fell in the water after the dragon attacked him, we knew he would make it somehow. And … oh, surprise, Bronn jumps in and saves him.</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: They did kill some characters in this series, though. What was that one’s name …?</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: Exactly, see! You can’t even remember who died!</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: Hmm. The only thing I didn’t like about this series was that it was shorter than the others. Seven episodes instead of ten. Maybe they spent all their money on that dragon!</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: Right! I don’t understand why they did it, as all the fans would happily watch ten episodes.</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: I reckon that now they’re not using the story in the books any more, they don’t have as many ideas.</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: That would explain why they’re not being as brave with the story too. It’s more like a Hollywood film than a TV show now.</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: So, is Tyrion still your favourite character?</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: You know … surprisingly, I think my favourite might be Cersei.</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: What?!</p><p><strong>Woman</strong>: She’s so interesting! All the awful things she’s done and the way she’s just aiming for revenge, even though it won’t make her happy. She still surprises us because we’re expecting her to have a happy ending where she sees her mistakes and becomes a good person. But she never does, no matter what it costs her. She’s unpredictable because we just can’t believe anyone would be like her.</p><p><strong>Man</strong>: I guess. You don’t have to like a character for them to be your favourite!</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>Presenter: So, today’s expert teacher is Gabriella, a university English teacher from Leeds. Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.<br>主持人：今天的专家老师是来自利兹的大学英语老师 Gabriella。加布里埃拉，您好，感谢您今天加入我们。</p><p>Gabriella: Thanks for having me!<br>加布里埃拉：谢谢你邀请我！</p><p>Presenter: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account.

Welcome to the first lecture of our new course in Positive Psychology. While some people may associate psychology with looking at what’s wrong with us, and at what problems we have, there is much more to psychology than that. Positive psychology, for example, looks at how to help people become happier.大家下午好。欢迎来到我们积极心理学新课程的第一讲。虽然有些人可能将心理学与观察我们的毛病和问题联系在一起，但心理学的意义远不止于此。例如，积极心理学研究如何帮助人们变得更快乐。</p><p>This lecture begins with a question: what makes a happy life?本讲座以一个问题开始：什么才是幸福的生活？</p><p>Now, I’m going to give you one possible answer. A happy life is a life in which you are completely absorbed in what you do. Now, how does this compare with what you and your partner said? 现在，我将给你一个可能的答案。幸福的生活就是完全专注于自己所做的事情的生活。现在，这与您和您的伴侣所说的相比如何？</p><p>This answer comes from the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and the theory of flow. Csikszentmihalyi is a psychologist who has spent much of his professional life on the study of what makes people happy and how we can find happiness.这个答案来自 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi 的著作和心流理论。 Csikszentmihalyi 是一位心理学家，他将职业生涯的大部分时间用于研究什么能让人们快乐以及我们如何找到快乐。</p><p>Csikszentmihalyi suggests the theory that happiness is not caused by external events or things that happen to us. Our perception of these things and how we see these events either makes us happy or sad. In other words, if we want happiness, we have to actively look for it. However, this does not mean that we should always look for happiness! Csikszentmihalyi believed that our happiest moments happen when we are in a state of flow.Csikszentmihalyi 提出了这样的理论：幸福不是由外部事件或发生在我们身上的事情引起的。我们对这些事情的看法以及我们如何看待这些事件要么让我们高兴，要么让我们悲伤。换句话说，如果我们想要幸福，就必须主动去寻找。然而，这并不意味着我们应该永远寻找幸福！ Csikszentmihalyi 相信，当我们处于心流状态时，我们最幸福的时刻就会发生。</p><p>The theory of flow can be summarised like this: when we are totally involved in, or focused on, what we are doing, we are in a state of flow.心流理论可以这样概括：当我们完全投入或专注于我们正在做的事情时，我们就处于心流状态。</p><p>Csikszentmihalyi got the inspiration for this theory when he noticed how artists worked in a studio. They completely lost track of time, they didn’t notice they were hungry or tired, and they could work for hours, even days, without stopping. Anyone I have spoken to who has experienced this state of concentration has said it’s difficult to explain. The best way to explain it is that it is like being in a river and the flow of the water carries you away.当奇克森特米哈伊注意到艺术家如何在工作室工作时，他得到了这一理论的灵感。他们完全忘记了时间，他们没有注意到自己饿了或累了，他们可以不停地工作几个小时，甚至几天。与我交谈过的任何经历过这种专注状态的人都说这很难解释。最好的解释是，它就像在一条河里，水流把你带走。</p><p>For the rest of this lecture, I will explore this theory of flow in more detail. First we will look at Csikszentmihalyi’s life, and how it influenced his ideas. Then we will look at the conditions that go with a state of flow. What creates flow, exactly? Finally, we will look at activities that can help us achieve flow in our everyday lives. Will this course make you happy for life? Well, maybe. Maybe. 在本次讲座的其余部分，我将更详细地探讨这种流动理论。首先，我们来看看奇克森特米哈伊的生活，以及它如何影响他的思想。然后我们将看看与心流状态相关的条件。究竟是什么创造了心流？最后，我们将研究可以帮助我们在日常生活中实现心流的活动。这门课程会让你一生幸福吗？也许。或许。</p><p>Right, let’s get started. If you look at the next slide …好的，让我们开始吧。如果你看下一张幻灯片……</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="An-introduction-to-a-lecture-–-1"><a href="#An-introduction-to-a-lecture-–-1" class="headerlink" title="An introduction to a lecture – 1"></a>An introduction to a lecture – 1</h4><p>Put the topics in the order they are mentioned.</p><p>Write a number (1–6) to put the topics in the order they are mentioned.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>()Examples of flow<br>()An outline of the rest of the lecture<br>()One definition of a happy life<br>()The difference between psychology and positive psychology<br>()Csikszentmihalyi and his work<br>()What makes a happy life?</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/03/22/b1-listening-06-introduction-lecture/image-20240523201257775.png" class="" title="image-20240523201257775"><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p>(2)What makes a happy life?<br>(4)Csikszentmihalyi and his work<br>(6)An outline of the rest of the lecture<br>(1)The difference between psychology and positive psychology<br>(5)Examples of flow<br>(3)One definition of a happy life</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/03/22/b1-listening-06-introduction-lecture/image-20240523205050183.png" class="" title="image-20240523205050183"><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="An-introduction-to-a-lecture-–-2"><a href="#An-introduction-to-a-lecture-–-2" class="headerlink" title="An introduction to a lecture – 2"></a>An introduction to a lecture – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>Positive psychology focuses on people’s problems.<br>True<br>False</li><li>The teacher asks the students to think about what a happy life is.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi believes that external events are the main things that make us happy or sad.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Csikszentmihalyi believes that a happy life means being very focused on what you do.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Csikszentmihalyi studied depression, and from there learned about happiness.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Flow means being completely absorbed in what you are doing.<br>True<br>False</li><li>Csikszentmihalyi was influenced by watching creative people.<br>True<br>False</li><li>The rest of the lecture will look at what other psychologists think of this theory.<br>True<br>False</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>Positive psychology focuses on people’s problems.<br>True<br>✔False</li><li>The teacher asks the students to think about what a happy life is.<br>✔True<br>False</li><li>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi believes that external events are the main things that make us happy or sad.<br>True<br>✔False</li><li>Csikszentmihalyi believes that a happy life means being very focused on what you do.<br>✔True<br>False</li><li>Csikszentmihalyi studied depression, and from there learned about happiness.<br>True<br>✔False</li><li>Flow means being completely absorbed in what you are doing.<br>✔True<br>False</li><li>Csikszentmihalyi was influenced by watching creative people.<br>✔True<br>False</li><li>The rest of the lecture will look at what other psychologists think of this theory.<br>True<br>✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><img src="/2024/03/22/b1-listening-06-introduction-lecture/image-20240523205333329.png" class="" title="image-20240523205333329"><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>Have you ever been in a ‘state of flow’ while doing an activity?<br>您在进行某项活动时是否曾处于“心流状态”？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="perception"><a href="#perception" class="headerlink" title="perception"></a>perception</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;pəˈsepʃ(ə)n&#x2F;美&#x2F;pərˈsepʃ(ə)n&#x2F;<br>n.看法，认识；感觉，感知；洞察力；&lt;法律&gt;（租金、农作物等的）收取，占有</p><p>高中 | CET4 | CET6 | IELTS | TOEFL | GRE | GMAT | SAT | 商务英语<br>复数perceptions</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>perception&#x2F;pəˈsɛpʃən&#x2F;|CET4 TEM8</p><ol><li><p>N-COUNT Your perception of something is the way that you think about it or the impression you have of it. 理解; 看法</p><p>•  He is interested in how our perceptions of death affect the way we live.<br>他对我们的死亡观如何影响我们的生活方式感兴趣。</p></li><li><p>N-UNCOUNT Someone who has perception realizes or notices things that are not obvious. 洞察力</p><p>•  It did not require a lot of perception to realize the interview was over.<br>不需要很强的洞察力就可以意识到面试结束了。</p></li><li><p>N-COUNT Perception is the recognition of things using your senses, especially the sense of sight.

Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Thanks for having me!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Yep, sounds familiar!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?</p><p><strong>Gabriella</strong>: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question. Or, for example, ‘And which office is that again?’ Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I get you …</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>Presenter: So, today’s expert teacher is Gabriella, a university English teacher from Leeds. Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.<br>主持人：今天的专家老师是来自利兹的大学英语老师 Gabriella。加布里埃拉，您好，感谢您今天加入我们。</p><p>Gabriella: Thanks for having me!<br>加布里埃拉：谢谢你邀请我！</p><p>Presenter: So, I have to confess today’s topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn’t so bad. At least I’m in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it’s like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.<br>演讲者：所以，我不得不承认今天的话题是我非常不擅长的：倾听。大多数人说口语是学习一门新语言中压力最大的部分，但对我来说，德语水平为 B1，口语并没有那么糟糕。至少我可以控制它。但是听着……哇……人们说话太快了，就像我的大脑停止运转一样。我真的很奇怪而且不善于倾听吗？告诉我，老实说，我可以接受。</p><p>Gabriella: No, you’re not strange. In fact, it’s really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can’t ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it’s gone.<br>加布里埃拉：不，你并不奇怪。事实上，这真的很常见。你知道，在考试中，大多数人的口语成绩比听力成绩要好。当然，考试与现实生活不同，因为在考试中你不能要求重复或解释某些内容。通常，您只有一次或两次听对话的机会，然后就没有了。</p><p>Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, ‘Sorry, can you repeat that, please?’, especially if I still don’t understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don’t do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I’m still lost!<br>主持人：是的，但在现实生活中，我总是觉得自己很愚蠢，总是说“抱歉，请你重复一遍？”，尤其是当他们重复一遍我仍然不明白的时候。外面的人在听，我希望你不要这样做——很多时候，人们只是以同样快的速度重复他们所说的话，而我仍然迷失了！</p><p>Gabriella: They do, don’t they? In real life, you’ve got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.<br>加布里埃拉：他们会的，不是吗？在现实生活中，你有两种策略。一是假装理解并尽快结束对话。</p><p>Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!<br>主持人：是的，听起来很熟悉！</p><p>Gabriella: But, obviously that’s not going to help if it’s a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you’re just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn’t matter. But imagine you’re at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?<br>加布里埃拉：但是，如果这是一场高风险的对话，显然这不会有帮助。它可能会产生重要的后果。我的意思是，如果你只是在公交车站和一个陌生人聊天，那也没关系。但想象一下，您在政府办公室或银行，试图找出获取身份证件或开立银行账户所需的文件。那你能做什么呢？</p><p>Presenter: I hope you’ve got the answer, Gabriella, because I’m coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!<br>演示者：我希望您能得到答案，加布里埃拉，因为一想到这两种情况我就冒出一身冷汗！</p><p>Gabriella: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.<br>加布里埃拉：另一个策略是总结他们所说的内容。</p><p>Presenter: But how can you do that if you didn’t understand what they said?<br>演示者：但是如果你听不懂他们说的话，你怎么能做到这一点呢？</p><p>Gabriella: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, ‘OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?’ and make it a question. Or, for example, ‘And which office is that again?’ Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you’re controlling the conversation a bit more.<br>加布里埃拉：啊，好吧，你只是开始总结，所以你可能会用德语说，“好吧，所以我要做的第一件事是……？”并提出一个问题。或者，例如，“那又是哪个办公室？”把它分解成更小的问题，对方自然会开始回答。这样你就可以更好地控制谈话。</p><p>Presenter: I get you …<br>主持人：我明白你…</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-1"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 1"></a>A weather forecast – 1</h4><p>Put the words in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>thunderstorms        dry          showers        a heatwavewet weather            drizzle          bright</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113807360.png" alt="image-20240409113807360"></p><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Rainy weather</strong><br>thunderstorms<br>showers<br>drizzle<br>wet weather</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Sunny weather</strong><br>bright<br>a heatwave<br>dry</p></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409113916707.png" alt="image-20240409113916707"></p><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-weather-forecast-–-2"><a href="#A-weather-forecast-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A weather forecast – 2"></a>A weather forecast – 2</h4><p>Are the sentences true or false?</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>TrueFalse</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>It will start raining at lunchtime today in the east.<br>True✔False</li><li>The weather in the north-west will be worse than in the south.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>There will be thunder in Leeds tonight.<br>True✔False</li><li>Most of England will be hot this week.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>Wet weather will move from the north to the south at the weekend.<br>✔TrueFalse</li><li>It will stay hot when the rain comes.<br>True✔False</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>今天午餐时间东部地区将开始下雨。<br>正确✔错误</li><li>西北地区的天气会比南方更糟糕。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>今晚利兹将有雷声。<br>正确 ✔错误</li><li>本周英格兰大部分地区将会很热。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>周末，潮湿天气将从北方转移到南方。<br>✔正确 错误</li><li>下雨时天气会很热。<br>正确 ✔错误</li></ol></blockquote><p><img src="/b1-listening-04-weather-forecast/image-20240409114404587.png" alt="image-20240409114404587"></p><h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>What do you do to help with listening? 你会做什么来提高听力？</p><h3 id="Vocabulary"><a href="#Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Vocabulary"></a>Vocabulary</h3><h4 id="shower"><a href="#shower" class="headerlink" title="shower"></a>shower</h4><ul><li>简易<blockquote><p>英&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə(r)&#x2F;美&#x2F;ˈʃaʊər&#x2F;<br>n.淋浴器，花洒；淋浴间，淋浴室；淋浴，洗澡；阵雨，阵雪；（落下的东西）一大批，一阵； 流星雨；&lt;美&gt;（为即将结婚或分娩的女子举行的）送礼聚会；&lt;英，非正式&gt; 一群乌合之众，一群笨蛋</p><p>v.淋浴，洗澡；洒落，（使）纷纷降落；朝……阵雨般地扔（大量小东西）（shower sb. with）；大量给予，慷慨给予</p><p>初中 | 高中 | CET4 | CET6 | 考研 | TOEFL | 商务英语<br>复数showers第三人称单数showers现在分词showering过去式showered过去分词showered</p></blockquote></li><li>《柯林斯英汉双解大词典》<blockquote><p>shower&#x2F;ˈʃaʊə&#x2F;|CET4 TEM4<br>showeringshoweredshowers</p><ol><li>N-COUNT A shower is a device for washing yourself.

Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things.</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Yes, I know, but if there’s no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate.</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: I completely agree, Nina. OK. So, what do you want us to do?</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Stefano, can you look for a successful trainer who specialises in running workshops and team-building sessions on diversity and inclusion?</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: Sure. I’ll be happy to.</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: And Brenda, can you find a fun venue? Somewhere that is quite diverse itself.

What are we going to do?布伦达：那么，这是什么意思？我们会做什么？</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Well, we need to create a workplace charter.

We could run some workshops and get ideas from the employees about how we can create a more inclusive workplace.斯特凡诺：这是个好主意。我们可以举办一些研讨会，并从员工那里获取有关如何创建更具包容性的工作场所的想法。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Exactly. I was thinking that before that we could run some team-building sessions so they can experience the value of diversity for themselves.尼娜：没错。我想在此之前我们可以举办一些团队建设课程，以便他们能够亲身体验多元化的价值。</p><p><strong>Brenda</strong>: Yes, I like that. Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things.布伦达：是的，我喜欢这样。许多人将多样性视为负面事物，通常是因为存在不同的观点或做事方式。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Yes, I know, but if there’s no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate.尼娜：是的，我知道，但如果没有多样性，那么风险就是我们所有人都以同样的方式工作，思考同样的问题，看待世界也一样。这使得创造力和创新变得困难。</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: I completely agree, Nina. OK. So, what do you want us to do?斯特凡诺：我完全同意，尼娜。好的。那么，你想让我们做什么？</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Stefano, can you look for a successful trainer who specialises in running workshops and team-building sessions on diversity and inclusion?尼娜：斯特凡诺，您能否寻找一位成功的培训师，专门举办关于多样性和包容性的研讨会和团队建设课程？</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: Sure. I’ll be happy to.斯特凡诺：当然。我会很乐意的。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: And Brenda, can you find a fun venue? Somewhere that is quite diverse itself. Something that’s not the usual seminar-style environment?尼娜：布伦达，你能找到一个有趣的场所吗？某个地方本身就很多样化。这不是通常的研讨会式环境吗？</p><p><strong>Brenda</strong>: Sure. That’ll be fun.布伦达：当然。那会很有趣。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: And I’m going to do some further research into how other organisations are benefiting from their diversity. I can share this with the whole team.尼娜：我将进一步研究其他组织如何从其多样性中受益。我可以与整个团队分享这一点。</p></blockquote><h4 id="Task-1"><a href="#Task-1" class="headerlink" title="Task 1"></a>Task 1</h4><ul><li><p>Question</p><blockquote><ol><li>The team has grown and become more diverse in the past year.TrueFalse</li><li>Everyone in the team respects and values everyone else.TrueFalse</li><li>They’re going to create a workplace charter to encourage diversity, equality and inclusion.

I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn’t it? It says here it’s about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it’s about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Yes, but in space that’s not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That’s why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn’t sound so big when you look at it that way.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you’re right. What other similarities are there between the two planets?</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Let’s see … not the colour, obviously!</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons!</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth’s day is 24 hours but Mars’s is about half an hour longer.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: You’re right. OK, any other things they both share?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I suppose you could say they have water in common.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Could you? How?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It’s just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Ah, I see. I don’t think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth’s air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Mars doesn’t really have air, not compared with Earth. It’s got about one per cent as much air as Earth.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Right, and it’s mostly carbon dioxide.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Gravity is another difference. I didn’t know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it’s much less than on Earth, of course.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth’s gravity.</p><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: OK, let’s see what you’ve found …</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: So you’ve got a few minutes to discuss with your partner.老师：那么你有几分钟时间与你的搭档讨论。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: So, as far as I know, the main similarity between Mars and Earth is that they can both support human life.学生 1：据我所知，火星和地球的主要相似之处在于它们都可以支持人类生命。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah, but do we know that’s actually true? I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn’t it? It says here it’s about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold.学生 2：是的，但我们知道这是真的吗？我的意思是，火星比地球冷得多，不是吗？据说这里大部分时间的气温约为负55度，而在地球上只有像南极洲这样的地方才会这么冷。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun?学生 1：是的。那么，我想你可以说两颗行星到太阳的距离相似？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it’s about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.学生 2：不可能！火星还远着呢！它说这里大约有2.28亿公里，而地球大约有1.5亿公里。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Yes, but in space that’s not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That’s why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn’t sound so big when you look at it that way.学生 1：是的，但在太空中并没有那么远。木星大约有 7.8 亿公里。这就是为什么我们在谈论太空距离时使用天文单位。地球距太阳 1 个天文单位，火星距太阳 1.3 个天文单位。当你这样看时，差异听起来并没有那么大。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you’re right. What other similarities are there between the two planets?学生 2：我明白你的意思。木星是 5.2 个天文单位，所以我想你是对的。这两颗行星之间还有哪些相似之处？</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Let’s see … not the colour, obviously!学生 1：让我们看看……显然不是颜色！</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons!学生 2：是啊！地球被称为蓝色星球，火星被称为红色星球，原因非常明显！</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.学生 1：它们的尺寸差别很大。火星的大小约为地球的一半。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth’s day is 24 hours but Mars’s is about half an hour longer.学生 2：这个怎么样？看起来两个行星上的白天几乎一样长。地球的一天是24小时，但火星的一天大约长半小时。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: You’re right. OK, any other things they both share?学生 1：你说得对。好吧，他们还有其他共同点吗？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I suppose you could say they have water in common.学生 2：我想你可以说它们有水的共同点。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Could you? How?学生 1：你可以吗？如何？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It’s just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.学生 2：嗯，地球 70% 是水，火星过去可能有巨大的海洋。只是现在那里的水估计大部分都结冰了。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Ah, I see. I don’t think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth’s air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?学生 1：啊，我明白了。但我认为我们不能说空气是一样的。地球上的空气大部分是氮气和氧气，但火星……？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Mars doesn’t really have air, not compared with Earth. It’s got about one per cent as much air as Earth.学生 2：与地球相比，火星实际上并没有空气。它的空气含量大约是地球的百分之一。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Right, and it’s mostly carbon dioxide.学生 1：是的，主要是二氧化碳。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Gravity is another difference. I didn’t know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it’s much less than on Earth, of course.学生 2：重力是另一个区别。我不知道，但火星的引力比月球大。但当然，它比地球上要少得多。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth’s gravity.学生 1：哦，是的。据称，火星的重力约为地球的 38%。</p><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: OK, let’s see what you’ve found …老师：好吧，让我们看看你发现了什么……</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task-1"><a href="#Task-1" class="headerlink" title="Task 1"></a>Task 1</h3><h4 id="A-student-discussion-–-1"><a href="#A-student-discussion-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A student discussion – 1"></a>A student discussion – 1</h4><p>Put the characteristics in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>Has more nitrogen<br>Is 50 per cent smaller<br>Is closer to the Sun<br>Has more air<br>Has stronger gravity<br>Used to have water  and oxygen than carbon dioxide<br>Has a longer day<br>Is colder</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Earth                         Mars</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/03/22/b1-listening-02-student-discussion/image-20240411094854178.png" class="" title="image-20240411094854178"><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><p>a</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>b</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/03/22/b1-listening-02-student-discussion/image-20240411095335284.png" class="" title="image-20240411095335284"><h4 id="Task-2"><a href="#Task-2" class="headerlink" title="Task 2"></a>Task 2</h4><ul><li><p>Question</p><blockquote><p>frozensameGravitynitrogensupportastronomical</p><ol><li>Most people think Mars can [] human life.</li><li>We measure distances in space using [] units.</li><li>The two planets aren’t the [] color.</li><li>Most of the water on Mars is probably [].</li><li>The air on Earth is mostly made up of [].</li><li>[] on Mars is just over one third as strong as on Earth.</li></ol></blockquote></li><li><p>Answer</p></li></ul><h4 id="Discussion-讨论"><a href="#Discussion-讨论" class="headerlink" title="Discussion 讨论"></a>Discussion 讨论</h4><blockquote><p>Do you think people will live on Mars one day?你认为有一天人们会在火星上生活吗？</p></blockquote>]]></content>

OK, it’s the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don’t get it.</p><p><strong>Professor</strong>: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: I’m not sure.</p><p><strong>Professor</strong>: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.</p><p><strong>Professor</strong>: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things.

Oh, lots of questions, I see. OK, we’ll go one at a time. Yes?<br>教授：好的，在我们继续之前，有人有问题吗？哦，我看看，有很多问题。好的，我们一次回答一个。是的？</p><p>Student: Thank you. You talked about Fibonacci numbers in the lecture. Sorry, I don’t understand. Can you explain?<br>学生：谢谢。您在讲座中谈到了斐波那契数列。抱歉，我不明白。你可以解释吗？</p><p>Professor: Of course. What do you want to know?<br>教授：当然。你想知道什么？</p><p>Student: OK … I hope this isn’t a silly question, but what does Fibonacci actually mean?<br>学生：好的……我希望这不是一个愚蠢的问题，但是斐波那契实际上意味着什么？</p><p>Professor: No question is ever silly – it’s always good to ask. OK, it’s the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.<br>教授：没有任何问题是愚蠢的——提出总是好的。好吧，这是一个人的名字。斐波那契是中世纪欧洲数学家。</p><p>Student: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don’t get it.<br>学生：啊，好的。谢谢。所以，我们知道他是一个人，但是斐波那契数是多少？我不明白。</p><p>Professor: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?<br>教授：斐波那契数列是一个数字序列。他们走1、1、2、3、5、8等等。你看到顺序了吗？你明白它是如何运作的吗？</p><p>Student: I’m not sure.<br>学生：我不确定。</p><p>Professor: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.<br>教授：好的。这就是它的工作原理。第一个数字是 1，然后又是 1，最后是 2。第三个数字是第一个数字加上第二个数字。第四个数字是第二个数字加上第三个数字：1 加 2 等于 3。第五个数字是第三个数字 2 加上第四个数字 3。因此斐波那契数列中的第五个数字是 5。</p><p>Student: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.<br>学生：啊！我想我现在明白了。但它们的重要性又如何呢？你说这些非常重要。</p><p>Professor: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere.<br>教授：是的，让我解释一下。这个数字序列很重要，因为我们在很多事情中都能看到它。斐波那契数在几何学中很常见，在自然界中也很常见，例如在植物中。我们随处可见这种顺序。</p><p>Student: Could you give us some more examples?<br>学生：您能给我们举一些更多的例子吗？</p><p>Professor: OK … well, we don’t have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?<br>教授：好吧……好吧，我们现在没有时间，但我可以在下节课上举更多例子，好吗？</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="Understanding-an-explanation-–-1"><a href="#Understanding-an-explanation-–-1" class="headerlink" title="Understanding an explanation – 1"></a>Understanding an explanation – 1</h4><p>Choose the correct answer.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The professor says there …<br>are lots of questions.<br>is only one question.<br>are no questions.</li><li>Fibonacci was …<br>from central England.<br>the first in a sequence of scientists.<br>a mathematician.</li><li>What is the next number in this Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, …<br>6<br>7<br>8</li><li>What does the professor say about Fibonacci numbers?<br>They are common.<br>They are uncommon.<br>They are very difficult to understand.</li><li>What does the professor promise?<br>To explain better<br>To bring examples to next class<br>To include this in the exam</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The professor says there …<br>✔are lots of questions.<br>is only one question.<br>are no questions.</li><li>Fibonacci was …<br>from central England.<br>the first in a sequence of scientists.<br>✔a mathematician.</li><li>What is the next number in this Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, …<br>6<br>7<br>✔8</li><li>What does the professor say about Fibonacci numbers?<br>✔They are common.<br>They are uncommon.<br>They are very difficult to understand.</li><li>What does the professor promise?<br>To explain better<br>✔To bring examples to next class<br>To include this in the exam</li></ol></blockquote><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="Understanding-an-explanation-–-2"><a href="#Understanding-an-explanation-–-2" class="headerlink" title="Understanding an explanation – 2"></a>Understanding an explanation – 2</h4><p>Put the words in order.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>not about the sequence. sure I’m </li><li>understand.

It takes around 8 to 10 hours to cross the canal.巴拿马运河是中美洲国家巴拿马的一条人工水道，连接大西洋和太平洋。全长仅82公里。如果乘船环游南美洲，则还需要行驶 15,000 公里。所以运河节省了大量的旅行时间。穿越运河大约需要8到10个小时。</p><p>The French started building the canal in 1881, but they couldn’t finish it. The project was started again in 1904 by the United States and the canal was finally finished in 1914. Many people died while they were building the canal, some say up to 25,000. For the rest of the 20th century, the United States controlled the canal, but gave control back to Panama in 2000.法国人于1881年开始修建运河，但未能完工。 1904年，美国再次启动这项工程，运河终于在1914年竣工。在修建运河的过程中，有很多人死亡，有人说多达25000人。在 20 世纪余下的时间里，美国控制着这条运河，但在 2000 年将控制权交还给了巴拿马。</p><p>Every year, around 40,000 ships come through the canal. These are mostly commercial ships. They transport goods for trade between Asia and America, or Europe. In 2016 the government of Panama made the canal bigger, so that now 99 per cent of ships can pass through it.每年约有 40,000 艘船只通过运河。这些大多是商船。他们运输亚洲和美洲或欧洲之间的贸易货物。 2016 年，巴拿马政府扩建了运河，现在 99% 的船只可以通过。</p><p>Let’s now turn to the role of the Panama Canal in the global economy …现在让我们谈谈巴拿马运河在全球经济中的作用……</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="Facts-and-figures-–-1"><a href="#Facts-and-figures-–-1" class="headerlink" title="Facts and figures – 1"></a>Facts and figures – 1</h4><p>Put the topics in order.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084104286.png" class="" title="image-20240401084104286"><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084217530.png" class="" title="image-20240401084217530"><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="Facts-and-figures-–-2"><a href="#Facts-and-figures-–-2" class="headerlink" title="Facts and figures – 2"></a>Facts and figures – 2</h4><p>Complete the sentences with the correct numbers.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084811948.png" class="" title="image-20240401084811948"><blockquote><ol><li>The Panama Canal connects ____ oceans. </li><li>It is ____ kilometres long. </li><li>It is ____ kilometres to travel around South America. </li><li>It takes ____ hours to cross the canal. </li><li>The canal was started in ____ . </li><li>It was finished in ____ . </li><li>Almost ____ people died while they were building the canal. </li><li>The control of the canal returned to Panama in ____ . </li><li>Every year, about ____ ships come through the canal. </li><li>Now the canal is bigger, and ____ per cent of ships can pass through it.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401085125668.png" class="" title="image-20240401085125668">]]></content>

In the meantime, we’ll continue with our projects as usual.<br>大家好。我知道你们都很忙，所以我会尽快做这个简报。我有一些关于管理团队变动的重要信息。如您所知，我们的部门主管詹姆斯·沃森将于本周末离职。他的继任者将从下个月底开始。与此同时，我们将像往常一样继续我们的项目。</p><p>I have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time.<br>我还有两点要点。首先，下个月将在几周内对员工停车场进行一些改进。在此期间它将关闭。</p><p>Don’t worry, we’ve found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It’s only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I know how much you all love working late!<br>别担心，我们已经找到解决方案了。我们可以使用当地教堂的停车场，直到我们自己的停车场准备好为止。如果您在上午 8.30 点之前抵达，请使用我们位于布朗街的小型停车场，如果您在此之后抵达，请直接前往教堂停车场。步行只需五分钟。但他们晚上需要，所以你必须在下午 6 点之前离开。抱歉——我知道你们有多喜欢工作到很晚！</p><p>The other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can’t use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card.

She just keeps emailing me about things that have nothing to do with work and nothing to do with me. What do you think I should do?<br>诺莉亚：是的，苏珊。她只是不断地给我发电子邮件，谈论一些与工作无关、与我无关的事情。你觉得我应该怎么做？</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: Well, if I were you, I’d email and ask her to stop sending them.<br>保罗：好吧，如果我是你，我会发电子邮件让她停止发送。</p><p><strong>Noelia</strong>: I’m not sure that’s a good idea. I have to be careful what I say as she’s quite an important client.<br>诺莉亚：我不确定这是个好主意。我必须小心我所说的话，因为她是一位非常重要的客户。</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: Erm, I’m not sure then. Perhaps you could try talking to Yuna about it?<br>保罗：嗯，那我不确定。也许你可以尝试和尤娜谈谈这件事？</p><p><strong>Bob</strong>: Er .. why don’t you try doing nothing?<br>鲍勃：呃..你为什么不尝试什么都不做呢？</p><p><strong>Noelia</strong>: Sorry?<br>诺莉亚：抱歉？</p><p><strong>Bob</strong>: Perhaps you could just … do nothing?<br>鲍勃：也许你可以……什么也不做？</p><p><strong>Noelia</strong>: Really? I’m not too sure about that.<br>诺莉亚：真的吗？我对此不太确定。</p><p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, I remember this guy I used to work with, Mark, and he kept emailing again and again and again, about all sorts, mostly unrelated to work. Well, I kept responding politely and he kept sending them. In the end, I stopped replying to his emails unless they were only about work.<br>鲍勃：嗯，我记得曾经和我一起工作的那个人，马克，他不断地一次又一次地发电子邮件，内容涉及各种各样的事情，大部分与工作无关。好吧，我一直有礼貌地回复，他也一直发送。最后，我不再回复他的电子邮件，除非它们只是与工作有关。</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: And what happened?<br>保罗：发生了什么事？</p><p><strong>Bob</strong>: He stopped sending them. It’s a bit like being faced with a dangerous snake. If you move quickly, it’ll bite you, but if you keep very still and do nothing, eventually it’ll move away and leave you alone. I had to learn the hard way.<br>鲍勃：他不再发送它们了。这有点像面对一条危险的蛇。如果你移动得很快，它就会咬你，但如果你保持静止不动，什么也不做，它最终会走开，留下你一个人。我必须以艰难的方式学习。</p><p><strong>Noelia</strong>: Hey, Bob. Have you got a minute?<br>诺莉亚：嘿，鲍勃。你有时间吗？</p><p><strong>Bob</strong>: Yeah.<br>鲍勃：是的。</p><p><strong>Noelia</strong>: So, I tried what you suggested and I only responded to Susan’s emails about work for a few days.

Now she only sends me work-related ones.<br>诺埃利亚：是的！现在她只给我发与工作相关的邮件。</p><p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, that’s very good news.<br>鲍勃：嗯，这是个好消息。</p><p><strong>Noelia</strong>: All thanks to you, Bob.<br>诺莉亚：这一切都谢谢你，鲍勃。</p><p><strong>Bob</strong>: Any time, Noelia, any time!

She was excited about her new role but soon realised that managing her new team would be a challenge.</p><p>Despite their friendliness, Gabriela didn’t feel respected as a leader. Her new staff would question her proposals openly in meetings, and when she gave them instructions on how to carry out a task, they would often go about it in their own way without checking with her. When she announced her decisions on the project, they would continue giving their opinions as if it was still up for discussion.</p><p>After weeks of frustration, Gabriela emailed her Swedish manager about the issues she was facing with her team. Her manager simply asked her if she felt her team was still performing, and what she thought would help her better collaborate with her team members. Gabriela found her manager vague and didn’t feel as if he was managing the situation satisfactorily.</p><p>What Gabriela was experiencing was a cultural clash in expectations. She was used to a more hierarchical framework where the team leader and manager took control and gave specific instructions on how things were to be done. This more directive management style worked well for her and her team in Brazil but did not transfer well to her new team in Sweden, who were more used to a flatter hierarchy where decision making was more democratic. When Gabriela took the issue to her Swedish manager, rather than stepping in with directions about what to do, her manager took on the role of coach and focused on getting her to come up with her own solutions instead.</p><p>Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede uses the concept of ‘power distance’ to describe how power is distributed and how hierarchy is perceived in different cultures. In her previous work environment, Gabriela was used to a high power distance culture where power and authority are respected and everyone has their rightful place. In such a culture, leaders make the big decisions and are not often challenged. Her Swedish team, however, were used to working in a low power distance culture where subordinates often work together with their bosses to find solutions and make decisions. Here, leaders act as coaches or mentors who encourage independent thought and expect to be challenged.</p><p>When Gabriela became aware of the cultural differences between her and her team, she took the initiative to have an open conversation with them about their feelings about her leadership. Pleased to be asked for their thoughts, Gabriela’s team openly expressed that they were not used to being told what to do. They enjoyed having more room for initiative and creative freedom. When she told her team exactly what she needed them to do, they felt that she didn’t trust them to do their job well. They realised that Gabriela was taking it personally when they tried to challenge or make changes to her decisions, and were able to explain that it was how they’d always worked.</p><p>With a better understanding of the underlying reasons behind each other’s behaviour, Gabriela and her team were able to adapt their way of working. Gabriela was then able to make adjustments to her management style so as to better fit the expectations of her team and more effectively motivate her team to achieve their goals.</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><h2 id="Millennials-in-the-workplace工作场所的千禧一代"><a href="#Millennials-in-the-workplace工作场所的千禧一代" class="headerlink" title="Millennials in the workplace工作场所的千禧一代"></a>Millennials in the workplace工作场所的千禧一代</h2><h3 id="Background背景"><a href="#Background背景" class="headerlink" title="Background背景"></a>Background背景</h3><p>Millennials (those born between the early 1980s and the early 1990s) make up a huge part of our workforce but they seem to lack loyalty to the companies and the leaders they work for. Multinational companies are noticing larger turnover rates of millennials as employee retention rates fall. This report looks at the findings of two large-scale surveys on the mindset of the millennial generation and explores how organisations can strive to address these needs, increase employee engagement and encourage retention.  千禧一代（1980年代初期至1990年代初期出生的人）构成了我们劳动力的重要组成部分，但他们似乎缺乏对公司和他们工作的领导者的忠诚。跨国公司注意到，随着员工保留率下降，千禧一代的离职率更高。该报告着眼于两项大规模调查的发现，对千禧一代的心态，并探讨了组织如何努力解决这些需求，增加员工的敬业度并鼓励保留。</p><h3 id="Research研究"><a href="#Research研究" class="headerlink" title="Research研究"></a>Research研究</h3><p>In a global survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), more than 40,000 millennial (born between 1983 and 1993) and non-millennial responses were collected on the topics of workplace culture, communication and working styles, pay structure, career development, work–life balance, etc.在PriceWaterhouseCoopers（PWC）进行的全球调查中，收集了40,000多个千禧一代（出生于1983年至1993年之间）和非千禧一代的回应，并在工作场所文化，沟通和工作风格，薪酬结构，职业发展，职业发展，工作与生活的主题上收集平衡，等等</p><p>In a separate global survey conducted by Deloitte, more than 10,000 millennials participated in a study about their perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work.在德勤（Deloitte）进行的另一项全球调查中，有10,000多名千禧一代参与了他们对复杂工作世界中威胁和机遇的看法的研究。</p><h3 id="Key-findings关键发现"><a href="#Key-findings关键发现" class="headerlink" title="Key findings关键发现"></a>Key findings关键发现</h3><ul><li>Millennials are as committed to their work as their more senior colleagues.千禧一代与更多的高级同事一样致力于他们的工作。</li><li>Millennials value interesting work and a good work–life balance.

Gabriela was then able to make adjustments to her management style so as to better fit the expectations of her team and more effectively motivate her team to achieve their

By considering new ideas and new ways of doing things, and trying to innovate, we can improve on our products&#x2F;services, increase sales, reduce costs and make our processes more effective and efficient. Innovation is key to increasing profits.</p><p>There are several ways a company can be innovative with their products and services.

Using the latest technology to improve your product&#x2F;service"></a>1. Using the latest technology to improve your product&#x2F;service</h5><p>When we think of innovation, we often think of new technologies. While they might be impressive, we should not use new technologies just because they are available. It is important to consider how the technology can improve our product&#x2F;service and make a difference to our customer. Companies that produce cars, toiletries, household appliances, etc. often have a large R&amp;D department to work on making their products better.</p><h5 id="2-Responding-to-customer-demands-by-changing-what-is-on-offer"><a href="#2-Responding-to-customer-demands-by-changing-what-is-on-offer" class="headerlink" title="2. Responding to customer demands by changing what is on offer"></a>2. Responding to customer demands by changing what is on offer</h5><p>By listening to customer feedback, we can get their opinions on how we are doing and find out about what it is that they want. We also need to be aware of changes in customer demands and keep up with the times. When fast-food restaurant McDonald’s realised that the market wanted healthier choices, they introduced fruit and salads, while removing the ‘super-size’ option from their menus.</p><h5 id="3-Offering-a-new-product-service-to-reach-new-customers"><a href="#3-Offering-a-new-product-service-to-reach-new-customers" class="headerlink" title="3. Offering a new product&#x2F;service to reach new customers"></a>3. Offering a new product&#x2F;service to reach new customers</h5><p>Your business might be doing well, but there is no growth or development and there is a risk that your competitors might take away some of your customers. Innovation sometimes means developing a new product that targets a different market. Although video games were often played by boys, in 2006, video games giant Nintendo introduced the game console Nintendo Wii, successfully targeting girls and older customers with games like Cooking Mama and Brain Training.  </p><h5 id="4-Changing-the-way-you-provide-a-service"><a href="#4-Changing-the-way-you-provide-a-service" class="headerlink" title="4. Changing the way you provide a service"></a>4. Changing the way you provide a service</h5><p>By looking at the changes to the customer’s lifestyle and needs, we sometimes realise that there might be better ways to serve them. Customers who do not have a lot of time might prefer to have their food or their shopping delivered to their homes, or they might like to do their banking online rather than in an actual bank.</p><p>Not all innovation will bring success to our businesses, but it can give us the opportunity to grow and learn more about what we do and what our customers might want.</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><h4 id="What-does-it-mean-to-be-innovative-in-business-商业创新意味着什么？"><a href="#What-does-it-mean-to-be-innovative-in-business-商业创新意味着什么？" class="headerlink" title="What does it mean to be innovative in business?商业创新意味着什么？"></a>What does it mean to be innovative in business?商业创新意味着什么？</h4><p>In order for a business to survive in today’s world, it is important that we regularly review what we are doing and how we are doing it.

Companies that produce cars, toiletries, household appliances, etc. often have a large R&amp;D department to work on making their products better.<br>当我们想到创新时，我们经常想到新技术。虽然它们可能令人印象深刻，但我们不应该仅仅因为新技术可用就使用它们。重要的是要考虑技术如何改进我们的产品&#x2F;服务并为我们的客户带来改变。生产汽车、盥洗用品、家用电器等的公司通常拥有庞大的研发部门来致力于改进他们的产品。</p><p><strong>2. Responding to customer demands by changing what is on offer</strong><br><strong>2. 通过改变所提供的产品来响应客户需求</strong></p><p>By listening to customer feedback, we can get their opinions on how we are doing and find out about what it is that they want. We also need to be aware of changes in customer demands and keep up with the times. When fast-food restaurant McDonald’s realised that the market wanted healthier choices, they introduced fruit and salads, while removing the ‘super-size’ option from their menus.<br>通过倾听客户的反馈，我们可以了解他们对我们的做法的意见，并了解他们想要什么。我们还需要了解客户需求的变化，与时俱进。当麦当劳快餐店意识到市场需要更健康的选择时，他们推出了水果和沙拉，同时从菜单中删除了“超大份”选项。</p><p><strong>3. Offering a new product&#x2F;service to reach new customers</strong><br><strong>3. 提供新产品&#x2F;服务来吸引新客户</strong></p><p>Your business might be doing well, but there is no growth or development and there is a risk that your competitors might take away some of your customers. Innovation sometimes means developing a new product that targets a different market. Although video games were often played by boys, in 2006, video games giant Nintendo introduced the game console Nintendo Wii, successfully targeting girls and older customers with games like Cooking Mama and Brain Training.<br>您的业务可能表现良好，但没有增长或发展，并且存在竞争对手可能抢走您的部分客户的风险。创新有时意味着开发针对不同市场的新产品。尽管视频游戏通常由男孩玩，但视频游戏巨头任天堂在 2006 年推出了游戏机 Nintendo Wii，通过《烹饪妈妈》和《大脑训练》等游戏成功瞄准了女孩和老年客户。</p><p><strong>4. Changing the way you provide a service</strong><br><strong>4. 改变提供服务的方式</strong></p><p>By looking at the changes to the customer’s lifestyle and needs, we sometimes realise that there might be better ways to serve them. Customers who do not have a lot of time might prefer to have their food or their shopping delivered to their homes, or they might like to do their banking online rather than in an actual bank.<br>通过观察客户生活方式和需求的变化，我们有时会意识到可能有更好的方式来服务他们。没有太多时间的客户可能更喜欢将食物或购物品送到家中，或者他们可能喜欢在网上而不是在实际的银行办理银行业务。</p><p>Not all innovation will bring success to our businesses, but it can give us the opportunity to grow and learn more about what we do and what our customers might want.<br>并非所有创新都会给我们的业务带来成功，但它可以让我们有机会成长并更多地了解我们的工作和客户可能想要什么。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task-1-任务1"><a href="#Task-1-任务1" class="headerlink" title="Task 1-任务1"></a>Task 1-任务1</h3><h4 id="Innovation-in-business-–-1"><a href="#Innovation-in-business-–-1" class="headerlink" title="Innovation in business – 1"></a>Innovation in business – 1</h4><p>Fill the gaps with the correct word.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>aware         recent        innovative       customers convenient      development        better         demands</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We need to introduce (1) ideas and ways of doing things so that we can improve and grow.

quality time with them.’<br>青少年对智能手机和社交媒体的沉迷可能要感谢他们的父母，因为他们的父母是智能手机的早期采用者。 38 岁的彼得是两个青少年的父亲，他说他过去经常使用手机或笔记本电脑。 “我始终保持在线状态，感觉自己一直在工作，”他说。 “如果我自己总是站在屏幕前，我怎么能告诉我的孩子们放下手机呢？”于是，晚上和周末，他就把SIM卡从智能手机上拿出来，装进只能打电话和发短信的老式手机里。 “在紧急情况下，我并没有完全与世界隔绝，但重要的是我为我的孩子们树立了更好的榜样，并与他们共度了更多美好时光。”</p><p>Is it only a matter of time until the generation above and
