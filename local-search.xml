I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn’t it? It says here it’s about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it’s about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Yes, but in space that’s not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That’s why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn’t sound so big when you look at it that way.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you’re right. What other similarities are there between the two planets?</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Let’s see … not the colour, obviously!</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons!</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth’s day is 24 hours but Mars’s is about half an hour longer.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: You’re right. OK, any other things they both share?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I suppose you could say they have water in common.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Could you? How?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It’s just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Ah, I see. I don’t think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth’s air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Mars doesn’t really have air, not compared with Earth. It’s got about one per cent as much air as Earth.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Right, and it’s mostly carbon dioxide.</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Gravity is another difference. I didn’t know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it’s much less than on Earth, of course.</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth’s gravity.</p><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: OK, let’s see what you’ve found …</p></blockquote><h4 id="Transcript-En-Cn"><a href="#Transcript-En-Cn" class="headerlink" title="Transcript-En-Cn"></a>Transcript-En-Cn</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: So you’ve got a few minutes to discuss with your partner.老师：那么你有几分钟时间与你的搭档讨论。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: So, as far as I know, the main similarity between Mars and Earth is that they can both support human life.学生 1：据我所知，火星和地球的主要相似之处在于它们都可以支持人类生命。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah, but do we know that’s actually true? I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn’t it? It says here it’s about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold.学生 2：是的，但我们知道这是真的吗？我的意思是，火星比地球冷得多，不是吗？据说这里大部分时间的气温约为负55度，而在地球上只有像南极洲这样的地方才会这么冷。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun?学生 1：是的。那么，我想你可以说两颗行星到太阳的距离相似？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it’s about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.学生 2：不可能！火星还远着呢！它说这里大约有2.28亿公里，而地球大约有1.5亿公里。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Yes, but in space that’s not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That’s why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn’t sound so big when you look at it that way.学生 1：是的，但在太空中并没有那么远。木星大约有 7.8 亿公里。这就是为什么我们在谈论太空距离时使用天文单位。地球距太阳 1 个天文单位，火星距太阳 1.3 个天文单位。当你这样看时，差异听起来并没有那么大。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you’re right. What other similarities are there between the two planets?学生 2：我明白你的意思。木星是 5.2 个天文单位，所以我想你是对的。这两颗行星之间还有哪些相似之处？</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Let’s see … not the colour, obviously!学生 1：让我们看看……显然不是颜色！</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons!学生 2：是啊！地球被称为蓝色星球，火星被称为红色星球，原因非常明显！</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.学生 1：它们的尺寸差别很大。火星的大小约为地球的一半。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth’s day is 24 hours but Mars’s is about half an hour longer.学生 2：这个怎么样？看起来两个行星上的白天几乎一样长。地球的一天是24小时，但火星的一天大约长半小时。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: You’re right. OK, any other things they both share?学生 1：你说得对。好吧，他们还有其他共同点吗？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: I suppose you could say they have water in common.学生 2：我想你可以说它们有水的共同点。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Could you? How?学生 1：你可以吗？如何？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It’s just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.学生 2：嗯，地球 70% 是水，火星过去可能有巨大的海洋。只是现在那里的水估计大部分都结冰了。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Ah, I see. I don’t think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth’s air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?学生 1：啊，我明白了。但我认为我们不能说空气是一样的。地球上的空气大部分是氮气和氧气，但火星……？</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Mars doesn’t really have air, not compared with Earth. It’s got about one per cent as much air as Earth.学生 2：与地球相比，火星实际上并没有空气。它的空气含量大约是地球的百分之一。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Right, and it’s mostly carbon dioxide.学生 1：是的，主要是二氧化碳。</p><p><strong>Student 2</strong>: Gravity is another difference. I didn’t know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it’s much less than on Earth, of course.学生 2：重力是另一个区别。我不知道，但火星的引力比月球大。但当然，它比地球上要少得多。</p><p><strong>Student 1</strong>: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth’s gravity.学生 1：哦，是的。据称，火星的重力约为地球的 38%。</p><p><strong>Teacher</strong>: OK, let’s see what you’ve found …老师：好吧，让我们看看你发现了什么……</p></blockquote><h4 id="Task-1"><a href="#Task-1" class="headerlink" title="Task 1"></a>Task 1</h4><ul><li><p>Question</p><img src="/2024/03/24/b1-listening-02-student-discussion/image-20240324170535096.png" class="" title="image-20240324170535096"></li><li><p>Answer</p><img src="/2024/03/24/b1-listening-02-student-discussion/image-20240323095306552.png" class="" title="image-20240323095306552"></li></ul><h4 id="Task-2"><a href="#Task-2" class="headerlink" title="Task 2"></a>Task 2</h4><ul><li><p>Question</p><blockquote><p>frozensameGravitynitrogensupportastronomical</p><ol><li>Most people think Mars can [] human life.</li><li>We measure distances in space using [] units.</li><li>The two planets aren’t the [] color.</li><li>Most of the water on Mars is probably [].</li><li>The air on Earth is mostly made up of [].</li><li>[] on Mars is just over one third as strong as on Earth.</li></ol></blockquote></li><li><p>Answer</p><img src="/2024/03/24/b1-listening-02-student-discussion/image-20240323095931262.png" class="" title="image-20240323095931262"></li></ul><h4 id="Discussion-讨论"><a href="#Discussion-讨论" class="headerlink" title="Discussion 讨论"></a>Discussion 讨论</h4><blockquote><p>Do you think people will live on Mars one day?你认为有一天人们会在火星上生活吗？</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things.</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Yes, I know, but if there’s no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate.</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: I completely agree, Nina. OK. So, what do you want us to do?</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Stefano, can you look for a successful trainer who specialises in running workshops and team-building sessions on diversity and inclusion?</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: Sure.

We’ve got a really diverse team here – people of different nationalities, backgrounds, religions, ages … and sometimes I don’t feel we make the most of this.尼娜：嗯，我们都知道团队的多样性是一件好事，但对于某些人来说，尊重和重视人们的差异也可能是一个挑战。我们这里有一支非常多元化的团队——来自不同国籍、背景、宗教、年龄的人……有时我觉得我们没有充分利用这一点。</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: Yes, and even if it isn’t specifically challenging, many people are simply unaware of the isolation that some team members may feel because they are different. Stefano：是的，即使这不是特别具有挑战性，但许多人根本没有意识到某些团队成员可能会因为与众不同而感到孤立。</p><p><strong>Brenda</strong>: So, what does this mean? What are we going to do?布伦达：那么，这是什么意思？我们会做什么？</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Well, we need to create a workplace charter. You know, one that promotes equality, diversity and inclusion.尼娜：嗯，我们需要制定一份工作场所章程。你知道，这是一个促进平等、多样性和包容性的国家。</p><p><strong>Brenda</strong>: That sounds like a good idea. But will people just see it as something the management team has created? Maybe they won’t even pay attention to it.布伦达：这听起来是个好主意。但人们会仅仅将其视为管理团队创造的东西吗？或许他们根本不会去关注它。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: I know. That’s why we’re going to involve everyone in creating it.尼娜：我知道。这就是为什么我们要让每个人都参与创建它。</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: That’s a good idea. We could run some workshops and get ideas from the employees about how we can create a more inclusive workplace.斯特凡诺：这是个好主意。我们可以举办一些研讨会，并从员工那里获取有关如何创建更具包容性的工作场所的想法。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Exactly. I was thinking that before that we could run some team-building sessions so they can experience the value of diversity for themselves.尼娜：没错。我想在此之前我们可以举办一些团队建设课程，以便他们能够亲身体验多元化的价值。</p><p><strong>Brenda</strong>: Yes, I like that. Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things.布伦达：是的，我喜欢这样。许多人将多样性视为负面事物，通常是因为存在不同的观点或做事方式。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Yes, I know, but if there’s no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate.尼娜：是的，我知道，但如果没有多样性，那么风险就是我们所有人都以同样的方式工作，思考同样的问题，看待世界也一样。这使得创造力和创新变得困难。</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: I completely agree, Nina. OK. So, what do you want us to do?斯特凡诺：我完全同意，尼娜。好的。那么，你想让我们做什么？</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: Stefano, can you look for a successful trainer who specialises in running workshops and team-building sessions on diversity and inclusion?尼娜：斯特凡诺，您能否寻找一位成功的培训师，专门举办关于多样性和包容性的研讨会和团队建设课程？</p><p><strong>Stefano</strong>: Sure. I’ll be happy to.斯特凡诺：当然。我会很乐意的。</p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: And Brenda, can you find a fun venue? Somewhere that is quite diverse itself.

The deadline for this essay is October the 18th. Not the 19th, not the 28th, not two days later because your dog was ill or your computer broke – the 18th. If it’s late, I won’t mark it. I won’t even read it – you’ll fail the assignment! So, please hand it in on time. You can even hand it in early, if you like!</p><p>You can email me the essays at <a href="mailto:&#106;&#46;&#x68;&#97;&#x72;&#x74;&#115;&#x68;&#111;&#x72;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x6c;&#x6d;&#117;&#46;&#x61;&#x63;&#x2e;&#117;&#107;">&#106;&#46;&#x68;&#97;&#x72;&#x74;&#115;&#x68;&#111;&#x72;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x6c;&#x6d;&#117;&#46;&#x61;&#x63;&#x2e;&#117;&#107;</a>. That’s H-A-R-T-S-H-O-R-N. I’ll reply to say I’ve got it. If I don’t reply within a day, it might mean I didn’t get it, so please email me again to make sure. You can also bring a paper copy of the essay to my office, but let’s be kind to the trees, OK? Email is better for the trees and for me.</p><p>Don’t forget that you must reference every idea or quote you use that isn’t your own idea. And the last page of your essay should be a list of all the books you used, in alphabetical order, not in the order you used them!</p><p>And lastly, make it easy for me to read! That means use a clear font. Arial is best, but Times New Roman is fine too. Not Comic Sans please! Size 12 font for the essay, and size 14 for the titles and subheadings. And use page numbers.

Sorry, I don’t understand. Can you explain?<br>学生：谢谢。您在讲座中谈到了斐波那契数列。抱歉，我不明白。你可以解释吗？</p><p>Professor: Of course. What do you want to know?<br>教授：当然。你想知道什么？</p><p>Student: OK … I hope this isn’t a silly question, but what does Fibonacci actually mean?<br>学生：好的……我希望这不是一个愚蠢的问题，但是斐波那契实际上意味着什么？</p><p>Professor: No question is ever silly – it’s always good to ask. OK, it’s the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.<br>教授：没有任何问题是愚蠢的——提出总是好的。好吧，这是一个人的名字。斐波那契是中世纪欧洲数学家。</p><p>Student: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don’t get it.<br>学生：啊，好的。谢谢。所以，我们知道他是一个人，但是斐波那契数是多少？我不明白。</p><p>Professor: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?<br>教授：斐波那契数列是一个数字序列。他们走1、1、2、3、5、8等等。你看到顺序了吗？你明白它是如何运作的吗？</p><p>Student: I’m not sure.<br>学生：我不确定。</p><p>Professor: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.<br>教授：好的。这就是它的工作原理。第一个数字是 1，然后又是 1，最后是 2。第三个数字是第一个数字加上第二个数字。第四个数字是第二个数字加上第三个数字：1 加 2 等于 3。第五个数字是第三个数字 2 加上第四个数字 3。因此斐波那契数列中的第五个数字是 5。</p><p>Student: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.<br>学生：啊！我想我现在明白了。但它们的重要性又如何呢？你说这些非常重要。</p><p>Professor: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere.<br>教授：是的，让我解释一下。这个数字序列很重要，因为我们在很多事情中都能看到它。斐波那契数在几何学中很常见，在自然界中也很常见，例如在植物中。我们随处可见这种顺序。</p><p>Student: Could you give us some more examples?<br>学生：您能给我们举一些更多的例子吗？</p><p>Professor: OK … well, we don’t have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?<br>教授：好吧……好吧，我们现在没有时间，但我可以在下节课上举更多例子，好吗？</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="Instructions-for-an-assignment-–-1Understanding-an-explanation-–-1"><a href="#Instructions-for-an-assignment-–-1Understanding-an-explanation-–-1" class="headerlink" title="Instructions for an assignment – 1Understanding an explanation – 1"></a>Instructions for an assignment – 1Understanding an explanation – 1</h4><p>Choose the correct answer.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The professor says there …<br>are lots of questions.<br>is only one question.<br>are no questions.</li><li>Fibonacci was …<br>from central England.<br>the first in a sequence of scientists.<br>a mathematician.</li><li>What is the next number in this Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, …<br>6<br>7<br>8</li><li>What does the professor say about Fibonacci numbers?<br>They are common.<br>They are uncommon.<br>They are very difficult to understand.</li><li>What does the professor promise?<br>To explain better<br>To bring examples to next class<br>To include this in the exam</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The professor says there …<br>✔are lots of questions.<br>is only one question.<br>are no questions.</li><li>Fibonacci was …<br>from central England.<br>the first in a sequence of scientists.<br>✔a mathematician.</li><li>What is the next number in this Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, …<br>6<br>7<br>✔8</li><li>What does the professor say about Fibonacci numbers?<br>✔They are common.<br>They are uncommon.<br>They are very difficult to understand.</li><li>What does the professor promise?<br>To explain better<br>✔To bring examples to next class<br>To include this in the exam</li></ol></blockquote><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="Understanding-an-explanation-–-2"><a href="#Understanding-an-explanation-–-2" class="headerlink" title="Understanding an explanation – 2"></a>Understanding an explanation – 2</h4><p>Put the words in order.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>not about the sequence. sure I’m </li><li>understand.

It takes around 8 to 10 hours to cross the canal.巴拿马运河是中美洲国家巴拿马的一条人工水道，连接大西洋和太平洋。全长仅82公里。如果乘船环游南美洲，则还需要行驶 15,000 公里。所以运河节省了大量的旅行时间。穿越运河大约需要8到10个小时。</p><p>The French started building the canal in 1881, but they couldn’t finish it. The project was started again in 1904 by the United States and the canal was finally finished in 1914. Many people died while they were building the canal, some say up to 25,000. For the rest of the 20th century, the United States controlled the canal, but gave control back to Panama in 2000.法国人于1881年开始修建运河，但未能完工。 1904年，美国再次启动这项工程，运河终于在1914年竣工。在修建运河的过程中，有很多人死亡，有人说多达25000人。在 20 世纪余下的时间里，美国控制着这条运河，但在 2000 年将控制权交还给了巴拿马。</p><p>Every year, around 40,000 ships come through the canal. These are mostly commercial ships. They transport goods for trade between Asia and America, or Europe. In 2016 the government of Panama made the canal bigger, so that now 99 per cent of ships can pass through it.每年约有 40,000 艘船只通过运河。这些大多是商船。他们运输亚洲和美洲或欧洲之间的贸易货物。 2016 年，巴拿马政府扩建了运河，现在 99% 的船只可以通过。</p><p>Let’s now turn to the role of the Panama Canal in the global economy …现在让我们谈谈巴拿马运河在全球经济中的作用……</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="Facts-and-figures-–-1"><a href="#Facts-and-figures-–-1" class="headerlink" title="Facts and figures – 1"></a>Facts and figures – 1</h4><p>Put the topics in order.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084104286.png" class="" title="image-20240401084104286"><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084217530.png" class="" title="image-20240401084217530"><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="Facts-and-figures-–-2"><a href="#Facts-and-figures-–-2" class="headerlink" title="Facts and figures – 2"></a>Facts and figures – 2</h4><p>Complete the sentences with the correct numbers.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401084811948.png" class="" title="image-20240401084811948"><blockquote><ol><li>The Panama Canal connects ____ oceans. </li><li>It is ____ kilometres long. </li><li>It is ____ kilometres to travel around South America. </li><li>It takes ____ hours to cross the canal. </li><li>The canal was started in ____ . </li><li>It was finished in ____ . </li><li>Almost ____ people died while they were building the canal. </li><li>The control of the canal returned to Panama in ____ . </li><li>Every year, about ____ ships come through the canal. </li><li>Now the canal is bigger, and ____ per cent of ships can pass through it.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/a2-listening-05-facts-figures/image-20240401085125668.png" class="" title="image-20240401085125668">]]></content>

In the meantime, we’ll continue with our projects as usual.<br>大家好。我知道你们都很忙，所以我会尽快做这个简报。我有一些关于管理团队变动的重要信息。如您所知，我们的部门主管詹姆斯·沃森将于本周末离职。他的继任者将从下个月底开始。与此同时，我们将像往常一样继续我们的项目。</p><p>I have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time.<br>我还有两点要点。首先，下个月将在几周内对员工停车场进行一些改进。在此期间它将关闭。</p><p>Don’t worry, we’ve found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It’s only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I know how much you all love working late!<br>别担心，我们已经找到解决方案了。我们可以使用当地教堂的停车场，直到我们自己的停车场准备好为止。如果您在上午 8.30 点之前抵达，请使用我们位于布朗街的小型停车场，如果您在此之后抵达，请直接前往教堂停车场。步行只需五分钟。但他们晚上需要，所以你必须在下午 6 点之前离开。抱歉——我知道你们有多喜欢工作到很晚！</p><p>The other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can’t use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card.
