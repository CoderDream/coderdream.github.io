This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>Most people have eaten some unusual food at least once in their life. What’s the most unusual thing you’ve ever eaten, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I ate camel in Australia, and I really didn’t like it, to be honest. What about you?</p><p>Phil<br>I ate caiman in Northern Argentina, and it was delicious!</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, OK. Good!</p><p>Phil<br>Well, in this programme we’ll be discussing some very unusual food known as ‘forever food’ – dishes, like stews and soups, which can be kept going day after day, year after year. We’ll also be learning some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can download, along with a worksheet for this programme, at our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Beth<br>But let’s get back to forever food, and a Bangkok restaurant called, Wattana Panich, that’s famous for a soup which has been cooking for over 50 years! Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:</p><p>David Shirley<br>I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.</p><p>Phil<br>David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.</p><p>Beth<br>A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?</p><p>Phil<br>Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop<br>In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.</p><p>Phil<br>Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.</p><p>Beth<br>Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.</p><p>Phil<br>Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:</p><p>Prof Martha Carlin<br>In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.</p><p>Beth<br>Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.</p><p>Phil<br>Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?</p><p>Beth<br>Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.</p><p>Phil<br>When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.</p><p>Beth<br>The verb replenish means to fill something up again.</p><p>Phil<br>If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.</p><p>Beth<br>When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort. Once again, our six minutes are up.

Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:<br>但是让我们回到永恒的食物，一家名为 Wattana Panich 的曼谷餐厅，它以已经烹饪了 50 多年的汤而闻名！这是电台听众大卫·雪莉 在亲自品尝了汤后致电 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain：</p><p>David Shirley(大卫·雪莉)<br>I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.<br>我以前从未听说过永久炖菜，但我第一次听说它是在曼谷的时候。我找到了一个炖了五十年的炖菜。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.<br>大卫尝到了永久炖菜的味道，这是一个将食材放入其中并不断烹饪的锅。这个罐子永远不会完全清空。相反，必要时加入新的成分和水并炖着 —— 在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，使食物轻轻冒泡。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?<br>50 年的汤可能并不符合每个人的口味，但永恒的食物却出奇地普遍。菲尔，我有一个关于 Wattana Panich 的 50 年老汤的问题要问你。您认为主要成分是什么？是：a） 牛肉？b） 鸡肉？或者，c） 蔬菜？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.<br>哦，我想是蔬菜。我认为这可能更安全。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。不仅仅是曼谷，人们永远烹饪食物。Fuchsia Dunlop 是一位作家和厨师，专门研究中餐。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”，关于一种据传已有 100 年历史的中国炖菜：</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop(紫红色邓禄普)<br>In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.<br>在中国，专业人士有时会谈论 bǎinián laolu，意思是，就像 100 年的肉汤一样。所以，我不知道这是否严格来说是正确的，但从理论上讲，只要你有良好的卫生习惯 —— 也就是说，你总是撇去它，每天煮它，并根据需要补充更多的水、更多的盐、更多的香料，你知道，你不断品尝 —— 那么它就会变得越来越丰富。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.<br>厨师需要补充永远的炖菜，在完全食用之前再次用新鲜食材填满。通过定期补充，有传言称有些菜肴可以使用 100 年。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.<br>哇，好好长的时间啊！Fuchsia 不知道同样的炖菜真的持续了 100 年是严格正确的还是完全正确的，但她认为理论上是可能的，只要它在煮沸时保持安全和卫生。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:<br>玛莎·卡林 教授是一位历史学家，对中世纪烹饪特别感兴趣。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”解释了为什么中世纪的人们会熟悉长效食物：</p><p>Prof Martha Carlin(Martha Carlin 教授)<br>In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.<br>从理论上讲，认为没有火柴或点火器的人是有道理的，对他们来说从头开始生火是一个相当繁琐的过程，如果他们有办法的话，自然会希望让炖锅冒泡，并避免不断点火的劳动。 还要确保他们随时都有热饭等着他们。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.<br>让热食在火上冒泡意味着总有现成的东西可以吃，并且不必从头开始生火。当你从头开始做某事时，比如做饭或生火，你从头开始做，不需要任何已经完成的帮助。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?<br>生火也很麻烦，这个形容词的意思是很难做到，需要时间和精力。但卡林教授说，只有富裕家庭才能买得起足够的木材来维持一整天的火势。不管怎样，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我饿了，贝丝，那么你的问题的答案是什么？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.<br>啊，我问你曼谷炖菜的主要成分是什么，你说蔬菜。恐怕这是错误的。事实上，它是牛肉。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个节目中学到的关于永恒食物的词汇，比如永久炖菜，一锅炖菜，定期添加新成分，让这道菜可以长时间食用。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.<br>当食物炖煮时，它会在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，以便轻轻冒泡。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The verb replenish means to fill something up again.<br>动词 replenish 的意思是再次填充某物。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.<br>如果某件事不是严格正确的，那么它就不完全或完全正确。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.<br>当您从头开始进行烹饪等活动时，您可以从头开始进行，而无需使用已经制作的任何产品。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?</p><p>Phil<br>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?</p><p>Beth<br>OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it’s probably about two litres.</p><p>Beth<br>Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.</p><p>Phil<br>And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Beth<br>Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it’s around 80% water.</p><p>Beth<br>OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:</p><p>Professor John Speakman<br>So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.</p><p>Phil<br>Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.</p><p>Beth<br>Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.</p><p>Phil<br>What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.</p><p>Beth<br>Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.</p><p>Phil<br>But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.</p><p>Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez<br>And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.</p><p>Phil<br>Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.</p><p>Beth<br>So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.</p><p>Phil<br>If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.</p><p>Beth<br>The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.</p><p>Phil<br>A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.</p><p>Beth<br>Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition. Once again, our six minutes are up.

Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?<br>我是 Beth。如今，我经常看到人们随身携带水瓶以确保他们喝得足够。你每天喝多少水，Phil？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?<br>哦，我不知道。也许大约一升？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?<br>还行。你知道你每天应该喝多少水吗？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it’s probably about two litres.<br>我想大概是两升。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.<br>啊，嗯，很多人听说的数字是每天两升。当然，每个人都需要喝一些水 —— 人体的一半以上是由水组成的。但是，我们究竟需要多少水才能保持健康呢？这就是我们将在本节目中讨论的内容，以及一些有用的新词汇。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>说到词汇，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上下载该节目中的所有新单词和短语，以及帮助您学习它们的工作表练习，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?<br>太好了！但首先我有一个问题要问你，Phil。我提到过，人体的一半以上由水组成，但我们血液中的水比例甚至更高。但多少呢？我们的血液是否：a） 大约 80% 是水？b） 大约 90% 的水？或者，c） 100% 水？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it’s around 80% water.<br>我认为大约 80% 是水。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:<br>好的，我将在稍后的节目中透露正确答案。我们的血液需要水，这样才能将营养物质输送到身体的细胞和器官。建议的量通常为每天 2 升。但是为什么？在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》讨论这个问题的是生物学家约翰·斯皮克曼教授：</p><p>Professor John Speakman(John Speakman 教授)<br>So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.<br>所以，我不确定它是如何得出的，但这个数字似乎已经控制了非常多的国家。所以，如果你看一下世界各地的政府建议，它们几乎都是一样的。他们几乎都说每个人都必须喝两升水。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.<br>Speakman 教授不知道每天 2 升的水数是如何得出的 —— 它是如何决定或计算的。尽管如此，每天喝两升的想法已经影响了世界各地的许多政府。当你说一个想法已经抓住了某件事时，你的意思是它已经控制了它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.<br>是的，斯皮克曼教授说，几乎所有政府都给出了几乎相同的建议。他用这个词，几乎是，意思几乎。例如，“几乎所有政府都建议每天喝两升”的意思是“几乎所有政府都建议这样做”。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.<br>然而，斯皮克曼教授没有为这个建议提供任何科学证据。正好 2 升的数字不是基于科学事实，它更像是一个大概的数字 —— 一个猜测的数字，但你仍然相信它大致正确。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.<br>实际上，我们体内的水量一直在变化。就像你花钱时银行余额会下降一样，当你呼吸、出汗或上厕所时，你的身体会一直流失水分。你到底需要喝多少水取决于你的身体需要补充多少水，而这主要取决于你的体型。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.<br>但是，当我们喝得少于我们应该喝的少时会发生什么呢？这是补水专家 Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 博士向 BBC 国际频道的 The Food Chain 描述脱水的影响。</p><p>Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez(Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 医师)<br>And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.<br>而且，很多时候我们开始脱水，但我们没有意识到我们脱水了。因此，我们感到疲倦，或者我们感到有点头痛，甚至我们认为我们饿了，然后我们去吃点东西，这是很常见的。实际上，我们正在发生的事情是我们口渴，我们脱水，我们开始出现一些脱水的迹象或症状。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.<br>Sanchez 博士描述了脱水的影响，脱水是指体内水分不足，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。她提到感到疲倦、头痛或口干是脱水的症状。症状是体内显示存在某种疾病或病症的迹象或感觉。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.<br>因此，无论您多喝一点还是少喝一点，每天喝两升左右的水似乎都是保持血液和身体健康的好方法。说到这里，Phil，是时候揭示我问题的答案了，我们血液中有多少百分比是水？你说 80%，答案是 90%。我们的血液由大约 90% 的水组成。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的词汇，从短语开始得出一个数字，意思是通过计算来决定它。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.<br>如果一个想法抓住了某件事，它就会控制它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.<br>这个短语的意思是几乎；例如，几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力，这意味着几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.<br>一个大概的数字是一个短语，意思是一个数字，这是一个可以接受的准确近似值。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.<br>脱水是指体内没有足够的水分，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition. Once again, our six minutes are up. Why not join me now and head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, download the worksheet for this programme, and test yourself to see how much you remember?

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Neil<br>Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.</p><p>Beth<br>Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple.</p><p>Beth<br>Oh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend.</p><p>Neil<br>What was the voice?</p><p>Beth<br>Hello?</p><p>Neil<br>Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about.</p><p>Beth<br>Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.</p><p>Neil<br>In this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.</p><p>Beth<br>So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?</p><p>Neil<br>So I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme.</p><p>As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the<br>difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea<br>So they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.</p><p>Neil<br>Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.</p><p>Beth<br>For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.</p><p>Neil<br>There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:</p><p>James Gallagher<br>Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea<br>I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.</p><p>Beth<br>James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.</p><p>Neil<br>As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?</p><p>Beth<br>It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, I think I said c) 61%.</p><p>Beth<br>I’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.</p><p>Neil<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.</p><p>Beth<br>If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.</p><p>Neil<br>The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.</p><p>Beth<br>The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.</p><p>Neil<br>And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not built your vocabulary and listening skills even more with the quiz and worksheet related to this programme? They’re both available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. See you there!</p><p>Beth<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是 Beth。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.<br>很多事情都会让我们感到尴尬 —— 当你的脸涨红，你希望自己能消失时，那种自我意识、不舒服的感觉。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?<br>你有没有经历过尴尬的时刻，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple.<br>是的，很多。有一次我在停车场遇到了我的父母，我看到他们开着他们的车来了，我以一种非常愚蠢的方式挥了挥手。但不幸的是，我很快发现那不是我的父母。那是另一对。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Oh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend.<br>哦，不，这真的很尴尬。我记得接电话时，我以为是我最好的朋友，我用非常愚蠢的声音说了一声“你好”，然后他们要求和我爸爸说话，但那不是我的朋友。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What was the voice?<br>声音是什么？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Hello?<br>你好？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about.<br>哦，天哪。但尴尬不仅仅是害羞和脸红。当谈到我们的健康时，有无穷无尽的事情值得尴尬。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.<br>是的，有些人感到非常尴尬，以至于他们没有在应该去看医生的时候去看医生，有时会带来严重的后果。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>In this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.<br>在这个节目中，我们将讨论医疗尴尬的问题，像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?<br>所以，我有一个问题。Neil，据英国《护理时报》报道，有多少百分比的受访者表示他们因尴尬而推迟了去看医生，后来又被诊断出患有健康状况？是：a） 21% ？b） 41% ？或者，c） 61% ？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%.<br>所以我认为这可能很多。所以 c） 61%。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme.<br>还行。我们将在节目结束时找出这是否正确。</p><p>As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the(作为人类，如果我们觉得自己与他人不同，我们会感到尴尬，尤其是当)<br>difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:<br>差异是物理的。但是，对医疗状况感到尴尬如何影响我们与医生的关系呢？以下是伦敦巴茨医院性健康顾问 Vanessa Apea 博士对 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的更多解释：</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)<br>So they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.<br>因此，他们会延迟进入诊所和寻求治疗，因此你经常会看到一些人，他们本来可以更早地被诊断出患有正在发生的事情，并且可能更早地接受了干预，但延迟了相当多。所以我觉得我们看到很多人真的在默默地忍受痛苦。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.<br>许多人延迟去看医生 —— 他们推迟去看医生或推迟到以后。因此，他们的问题没有得到诊断。To diagnose 是指通过医学检查来识别疾病或健康问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.<br>对一些人来说，尴尬的感觉是如此强烈，他们宁愿默默忍受 —— 在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦作斗争 —— 也不愿去看医生。但幸运的是，您可以做一些事情来提供帮助。写下你的问题，和朋友一起去，去看你信任的医生是 Apea 医生推荐的一些想法。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:<br>医生也可以通过多种方式提供帮助，正如 Vanessa Apea 博士在这里向 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的主持人 James Gallagher 解释的那样：</p><p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?<br>您能告诉我们您用了什么技巧来让人们放心吗？</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)<br>I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.<br>我为对话带来透明度，并拥有它，并说我将问你一些非常私人的问题，也可能有亲密的检查……我想向你保证，这是保密的，这是一个安全、不带评判的空间……所以说真的，我也经常说出创造那个空间的词。我希望，也要以我的方式，以及我的非语言暗示。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.<br>詹姆斯问医生可以做些什么来让人们放松 —— 让他们感到平静和放松 —— Apea 医生描述了她理想的对话：这是一个安全的空间，不带评判，所说的是保密的，保密的，不与任何人分享。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?<br>除了敏感地讨论令人尴尬的问题外，Apea 医生还使用非语言暗示 - 她脸上的表情、她的手部动作和她的语气，而不是语言，来与患者交流和放松。尴尬是正常的，在支持下，希望我们中的更多人会感到放心去看医生。好的，贝丝，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?<br>是的。我问你：有多少百分比的人说他们因为尴尬而推迟去看医生，但后来被诊断出患有健康状况？你还记得你说过的话吗，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I think I said c) 61%.<br>是的，我想我说的是 c） 61%。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.<br>恐怕这不是正确的答案。事实上，它是 a） 21% 或略高于五分之一。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的新词汇，从 delay 开始，推迟或推迟到以后。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition 的意思是通过识别症状和检查患者来识别它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.<br>如果你默默忍受，你会忍受痛苦的感觉，并在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦的感受作斗争。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.<br>短语动词 put someone at ease 的意思是让某人感到平静和放松。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.<br>形容词 confidential 的意思是保密和秘密，并描述不与其他任何人共享的信息。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not built your vocabulary and listening skills even more with the quiz and worksheet related to this programme? They’re both available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.

I can accept overtime from time to time if necessary, such as working to launch an urgent project. But I’d also like to be paid for it.<br>亚历克斯：这得看情况。如果有必要，我可以偶尔接受加班，比如为了发布一个紧急项目而加班。但我也希望能为此获得报酬。</p><p>Alex: But if it’s just a meaningless race to see who can <strong>work the longest hours or stay behind the latest</strong>, then I am afraid I can’t subscribe to that.<br>亚历克斯：但如果只是一场毫无意义的比拼，看谁<strong>工作时间最长或者下班最晚</strong>，那恐怕我无法认同这种做法。</p><p>Alex: But I know that you guys don’t encourage that sort of “<strong>rat race</strong>“ culture anyway.<br>亚历克斯：但我知道你们反正也不鼓励那种“<strong>激烈竞争、你追我赶</strong>”的文化。</p><p>Barry: I agree, we certainly don’t.<br>巴里：我同意，我们确实不鼓励。</p><p>Barry: If you’ve completed your tasks for the day, of course you can <strong>clock off</strong>.<br>巴里：如果你当天完成了自己的任务，当然可以<strong>下班打卡</strong>。</p><p>Barry: However, the company wants to see its employees constantly <strong>pushing boundaries</strong> and breaking into new fields, rather than just focusing on current businesses.<br>巴里：然而，公司希望看到员工不断地<strong>突破界限</strong>，开拓新的领域，而不只是专注于当前的业务。</p><p>Alex: <strong>Totally understood</strong>. After all, you are a <strong>start-up</strong> company and need people to be more <strong>proactive</strong>.<br>亚历克斯：<strong>完全理解</strong>。毕竟，你们是一家<strong>初创</strong>公司，需要员工更具<strong>主动性</strong>。</p><p>Alex: But to start, I’d still like to focus on doing my current job well.<br>亚历克斯：但一开始，我还是想先专注于把我目前的工作做好。</p><p>Alex: If I <strong>have time and effort to spare</strong>, I’ll keep exploring new possibilities.<br>亚历克斯：如果我<strong>有多余的时间和精力</strong>，我会继续探索新的可能性。 </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Hyper-growthadj.高速发展的<br>Be bound to do something注定要做某事<br>Work overtime加班<br>Work the longest hours加班最久<br>stay behind the latest下班最晚<br>Subscribe to an idea认同某观点<br>Clock off打卡下班<br>Push boundaries突破边界<br>totally understood完全理解<br>Start-up company初创公司，创业公司<br>Proactiveadj.激进的<br>Have time and effort to spare有余力</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/11/20/interview-practice-01/image-20241122085744448.png" class="" title="image-20241122085744448"><h3 id="06-面试中-领导力"><a href="#06-面试中-领导力" class="headerlink" title="06-面试中-领导力"></a>06-面试中-领导力</h3><blockquote><p>Barry: What has been the biggest leadership challenge for you so far?</p><p>Alex: Leadership, <strong>at the end of the day</strong>, is about managing your teams so they can produce the outcomes you want.</p><p>Alex: But as the head of a business, you need to manage both people and things at the same time.

Synthesis science breakthroughs have been key to the realization of quantum dot technologies, but important group III–group V semiconductors, including colloidal gallium arsenide (GaAs), still cannot be synthesized with existing approaches. The high-temperature molten salt colloidal synthesis introduced in this work enables the preparation of previously intractable colloidal materials. We directly nucleated and grew colloidal quantum dots in molten inorganic salts by harnessing molten salt redox chemistry and using surfactant additives for nanocrystal shape control. Synthesis temperatures above 425°C are critical for realizing photoluminescent GaAs quantum dots, which emphasizes the importance of high temperatures enabled by molten salt solvents. We generalize the methodology and demonstrate nearly a dozen III-V solid-solution nanocrystal compositions that have not been previously reported.</p><p>Topological grain boundary segregation transitions</p><p>拓扑晶界偏析相变</p><p>▲ 作者：VIVEK DEVULAPALLI, ENZE CHEN, TOBIAS BRINK, TIMOFEY FROLOV AND CHRISTIAN H.

Solute segregation triggering phase transitions at GBs has been suggested theoretically to offer different pathways to design interfaces, but an understanding of their intrinsic atomistic nature is missing. We combined atomic resolution electron microscopy and atomistic simulations to discover that iron segregation to GBs in titanium stabilizes icosahedral units (“cages”) that form robust building blocks of distinct GB phases. Owing to their five-fold symmetry, the iron cages cluster and assemble into hierarchical GB phases characterized by a different number and arrangement of the constituent icosahedral units. Our advanced GB structure prediction algorithms and atomistic simulations validate the stability of these observed phases and the high excess of iron at the GB that is accommodated by the phase transitions.</p><p>Soft hydrogel semiconductors with augmented biointeractive functions</p><p>软水凝胶半导体可增强生物交互功能</p><p>▲ 作者：YAHAO DAI, SHINYA WAI, PENGJU LI, NAISONG SHAN, ZHIQIANG CAO, YANG LI, ET AL.</p><p>▲链接：</p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp9314">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp9314</a></p><p>▲摘要：</p><p>水凝胶因其与生物组织的机械和化学相似性而闻名，广泛应用于生物技术，而半导体则提供先进的电子和光电功能，如信号放大、传感和光调制。将半导体特性与水凝胶设计相结合可以增强生物界面处的生物交互功能和亲密性，但由于聚合物半导体的亲水性较低，这很难实现。</p><p>研究组开发了一种溶剂亲和诱导组装方法，将不溶于水的聚合物半导体结合到双网络水凝胶中。这些半导体表现出软至81千帕的组织级模量、150%应变的拉伸率、高达1.4平方厘米&#x2F;伏&#x2F;秒的载流子迁移率。当其与生物组织结合时，该组织级模量可减轻免疫反应。</p><p>水凝胶的高孔隙度增强了半导体-生物流体界面的分子相互作用，从而实现了具有更高响应的光调制和具有更高灵敏度的体积生物传感。</p><p>▲ Abstract：</p><p>Hydrogels, known for their mechanical and chemical similarity to biological tissues, are widely used in biotechnologies, whereas semiconductors provide advanced electronic and optoelectronic functionalities such as signal amplification, sensing, and photomodulation. Combining semiconducting properties with hydrogel designs can enhance biointeractive functions and intimacy at biointerfaces, but this is challenging owing to the low hydrophilicity of polymer semiconductors. We developed a solvent affinity–induced assembly method that incorporates water-insoluble polymer semiconductors into double-network hydrogels. These semiconductors exhibited tissue-level moduli as soft as 81 kilopascals, stretchability of 150% strain, and charge-carrier mobility up to 1.4 square centimeters per volt per second. When they are interfaced with biological tissues, their tissue-level modulus enables alleviated immune reactions. The hydrogel’s high porosity enhances molecular interactions at semiconductor-biofluid interfaces, resulting in photomodulation with higher response and volumetric biosensing with higher sensitivity.</p><p><strong>能源科学Energy Science</strong></p><p>Unification of insertion and supercapacitive storage concepts: Storage profiles in titania</p><p>插入式储能和超级电容储能概念的统一：二氧化钛中的储能概况</p><p>▲ 作者：CHUANLIAN XIAO, HONGGUANG WANG, ROBERT USISKIN, PETER A.

Using tailored experiments on titanium oxide thin films of various thicknesses, we demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of both processes. For the interpretation of the entire storage profile encompassing both contributions, the (free) energies of the charge carriers in the mixed conductor and the neighboring phase are the only materials parameters required. The experimental results enable no less than a unification of insertion and supercapacitive storage, the first being dominant for thick films, the latter for thin films or negligible electronic conductivity. Therefore, the size of the storage medium and the nature of the current collecting phases can be used to tune power density versus energy density.</p><p><strong>地球科学Earth Science</strong></p><p>The fastest-growing and most destructive fires in the US (2001 to 2020)</p><p>美国增长最快、最具破坏性的火灾（2001~2020年）</p><p>▲ 作者：JENNIFER K.

Microplastics arise from multiple sources, including tires, textiles, cosmetics, paint, and the fragmentation of larger items. They are widely distributed throughout the natural environment, with evidence of harm at multiple levels of biological organization. They are pervasive in food and drink and have been detected throughout the human body, with emerging evidence of negative effects. Environmental contamination could double by 2040, and wide-scale harm has been predicted. Public concern is increasing, and diverse measures to address microplastic pollution are being considered in international negotiations. Clear evidence on the efficacy of potential solutions is now needed to address the issue and to minimize the risks of unintended consequences.</p></blockquote><p>百度网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1578qKxm-AlDnPJsTAK-eRw?pwd=7vzk">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1578qKxm-AlDnPJsTAK-eRw?pwd=7vzk</a><br>提取码：7vzk </p><p>夸克网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/a2a29b345a02">https://pan.quark.cn/s/a2a29b345a02</a></p><h3 id="0003-《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期"><a href="#0003-《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期" class="headerlink" title="0003_《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期"></a>0003_《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期</h3><p>通过百度网盘分享的文件：0003_《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zqek-JVYfv0ZwhxPb6JMeQ?pwd=j1yd">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zqek-JVYfv0ZwhxPb6JMeQ?pwd=j1yd</a><br>提取码：j1yd<br>–来自百度网盘超级会员V9的分享</p><p>我用夸克网盘分享了「0003_《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期」，点击链接即可保存。打开「夸克APP」，无需下载在线播放视频，畅享原画5倍速，支持电视投屏。<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/6b98465a60b4">https://pan.quark.cn/s/6b98465a60b4</a></p><h3 id="0004-《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期"><a href="#0004-《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期" class="headerlink" title="0004_《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期"></a>0004_《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期</h3><p>通过百度网盘分享的文件：0004_《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KiOFJmznGdcp6H4my8cKTA?pwd=4o4c">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KiOFJmznGdcp6H4my8cKTA?pwd=4o4c</a><br>提取码：4o4c<br>–来自百度网盘超级会员V9的分享</p><p>我用夸克网盘分享了「0004_《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期」，点击链接即可保存。打开「夸克APP」，无需下载在线播放视频，畅享原画5倍速，支持电视投屏。<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/6acc2ef36e16">https://pan.quark.cn/s/6acc2ef36e16</a></p><h3 id="0005-《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期"><a href="#0005-《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期" class="headerlink" title="0005_《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期"></a>0005_《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期</h3><p>通过百度网盘分享的文件：0005_《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/10Rliodix8kD_5kEVqnt1Bg?pwd=x6kl">https://pan.baidu.com/s/10Rliodix8kD_5kEVqnt1Bg?pwd=x6kl</a><br>提取码：x6kl<br>–来自百度网盘超级会员V9的分享</p><p>我用夸克网盘分享了「0005_《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期」，点击链接即可保存。打开「夸克APP」，无需下载在线播放视频，畅享原画5倍速，支持电视投屏。<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/ab7a3aa7854b">https://pan.quark.cn/s/ab7a3aa7854b</a></p><h3 id="0006-《科学》期刊，2024年11月15日，第6723期"><a href="#0006-《科学》期刊，2024年11月15日，第6723期" class="headerlink" title="0006_《科学》期刊，2024年11月15日，第6723期"></a>0006_《科学》期刊，2024年11月15日，第6723期</h3><blockquote><p>《科学》（20241115出版）一周论文导读</p><p>编译|冯维维</p><p>Science, 15 November 2024, Volume 386, Issue 6723</p><p>《科学》2024年11月15日，第386卷，6723期</p><p><img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/80/v2-6ffadebcd847231af563a144a50575a9_1440w.webp" alt="image"></p><p><strong>化学Chemistry</strong></p><p>Detection of interstellar 1-cyanopyrene: A four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</p><p>星际四环多环芳烃1—氰芘的检测</p><p>▲ 作者：GABI WENZEL, ILSA R.

Infrared emission bands show that PAHs are abundant in space, but only a few specific PAHs have been detected in the interstellar medium. We detected 1-cyanopyrene, a cyano-substituted derivative of the related four-ring PAH pyrene, in radio observations of the dense cloud TMC-1, using the Green Bank Telescope. The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is ~ 1.52×1012cm-2, from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds.</p><p>Synchronous recognition of amines in oxidative carbonylation toward unsymmetrical ureas</p><p>不对称尿素氧化羰基化过程中胺的同步识别</p><p>▲ 作者：JINHUI WANG, SHENGCHUN WANG, ZHIHONG WEI, PENGJIE WANG, YANWEI CAO, YANG HUANG, LIN HE, AND AIWEN LEI</p><p>▲链接：</p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl0149">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl0149</a></p><p>▲摘要：</p><p>不对称尿素常见于药品和生物活性化合物中。然而，设计策略来选择性地引入两种不同的胺来构建不对称脲仍然是一个挑战。研究者使用同步识别策略，利用自由基和亲核活化来区分仲胺和伯胺。</p><p>具体而言，铜催化剂优先将仲胺氧化为自由基，而钴催化剂将伯胺羰基化以产生钴酰胺。这些片段通过协同催化偶联产生具有高选择性的不对称脲，41种生物活性化合物和6种药物的修饰证明了这一点。</p><p>▲ Abstract：</p><p>Unsymmetrical ureas are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds.

They have H i column densities ?1022 cm?2, which is an order of magnitude higher than expected for a fully neutral intergalactic medium, and constitute a gas-rich population of young star-forming galaxies.</p><p>材料科学Materials Science</p><p>Unrecoverable lattice rotation governs structural degradation of single-crystalline cathodes</p><p>不可恢复的晶格旋转控制着单晶阴极的结构退化</p><p>▲ 作者：WEIYUAN HUANG, TONGCHAO LIU et al.</p><p>▲ 链接：</p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado1675">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado1675</a></p><p>▲ 摘要：</p><p>利用多尺度空间分辨率衍射和成像技术，我们观察到晶格旋转在单晶阴极中普遍存在，并在结构退化中起关键作用。</p><p>这些晶格旋转被证明是不可恢复的，并且在重复的循环中控制着不利晶格畸变的积累，导致结构和机械退化以及容量加速衰退。这些发现弥补了之前在快速性能失效和原子尺度结构退化之间的机制联系方面存在的知识差距。</p><p>▲ Abstract：</p><p>Leveraging multiscale spatial resolution diffraction and imaging techniques, we observe that lattice rotations occur universally in single-crystalline cathodes and play a pivotal role in the structure degradation.

In this work, we provide a potential account of the roots of this resilience based on observations with 10 congenitally blind children who gained sight late in life. Several months or years following their sight-restoring surgeries, the removal of color cues markedly reduced their recognition performance, whereas age-matched normally sighted children showed no such decrement. This finding may be explained by the greater-than-neonatal maturity of the late-sighted children’s color system at sight onset, inducing overly strong reliance on chromatic cues. Simulations with deep neural networks corroborate this hypothesis. These findings highlight the adaptive significance of typical developmental trajectories and provide guidelines for enhancing machine vision systems.</p><p>生物学Biology</p><p>Crows “count” the number of self-generated vocalizations</p><p>乌鸦会给自己ID叫声“计数”</p><p>▲ 作者：DIANA A.

In this work, we report the dislocation cutting of B2 (ordered body-centered cubic) nanoprecipitates, typically considered nonshearable intermetallics, in a lightweight compositionally complex steel during cryogenic tensile loading. Shearing is enabled by the high strength level for dislocation glide within the austenitic matrix, attributed to the substantial strengthening from subnanoscale local chemical ordering zones and the pronounced solid solution strengthening from the multiprincipal elements in the matrix. This mechanism not only harnesses the intense strengthening and strain hardening provided by otherwise impenetrable brittle nanoprecipitates but also introduces ductility through their sequential shearing with ongoing deformation. Our steel thus showcases ultrahigh cryogenic tensile strength up to 2 gigapascal at a remarkable tensile elongation of 34%.

Conventional approaches to tailoring thermal emission using metamaterials are hampered both by the limited spatial resolution of the required subwavelength material structures and by the materials’ strong absorption in the infrared. In this work, we demonstrate an approach based on the concept of topology. By changing a single parameter of a multilayer coating, we were able to control the reflection topology of a surface, with the critical point of zero reflection being topologically protected. The boundaries between subcritical and supercritical spatial domains host topological interface states with near-unity thermal emissivity. These topological concepts enable unconventional manipulation of thermal light for applications in thermal management and thermal camouflage.</p><p>Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in polar fluid–heliconical ferroelectric nematic phase</p><p>极性流体-螺旋铁电向列相的自发手性对称性破缺</p><p>▲ 作者：JAKUB KARCZ, JAKUB HERMAN, NATAN RYCH?OWICZ, PRZEMYS?AW KULA, EWA GóRECKA, JADWIGA SZYDLOWSKA, PAWEL W.

In other fishes, mothers provide products to the egg to determine the embryonic axes, but these killifish do not follow this script. Abitua et al. discovered that killifish blastomere cells spread across the yolk, aggregate, and form a body axis in the developing embryo without the instruction of the maternal determinant, a protein named Huluwa. Moreover, killifish repurposed two important signaling pathways, Nodal and β-catenin, to coordinate aggregation and axis formation. This developmental strategy may help annual killifish survive drought conditions, and it shares features with the self-organization process of synthetic mammalian embryos.</p><p>Two-stage evolution of mammalian adipose tissue thermogenesis</p><p>哺乳动物脂肪组织产热的两阶段演化</p><p>▲ 作者：SUSANNE KEIPERT, MICHAEL J.

BAT thermogenesis is considered an overarching mammalian trait, but its evolutionary origin is unknown. We show that adipose tissue of marsupials, which diverged from eutherian mammals ~150 million years ago, expresses a nonthermogenic UCP1 variant governed by a partial transcriptomic BAT signature similar to that found in eutherian beige adipose tissue. We found that the reconstructed UCP1 sequence of the common eutherian ancestor displayed typical thermogenic activity, whereas therian ancestor UCP1 is nonthermogenic. Thus, mammalian adipose tissue thermogenesis may have evolved in two distinct stages, with a prethermogenic stage in the common therian ancestor linking UCP1 expression to adipose tissue and thermal stress. We propose that in a second stage, UCP1 acquired its thermogenic function specifically in eutherians, such that the onset of mammalian BAT thermogenesis occurred only after the divergence from marsupials.</p></blockquote><h3 id="《科学》2024年7月12日，第385卷，6705期"><a href="#《科学》2024年7月12日，第385卷，6705期" class="headerlink" title="《科学》2024年7月12日，第385卷，6705期"></a>《科学》2024年7月12日，第385卷，6705期</h3><blockquote><p>《科学》（20240712出版）一周论文导读</p><p>编译|未玖</p><p>Science,  12 JUL 2024, VOL 385, ISSUE 6705</p><p>《科学》2024年7月12日，第385卷，6705期</p><p><img src="/001_%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E6%9D%82%E5%BF%97/6693c446e4b03b5da6d12eb1-17332700632135.jpeg" alt="image"></p><p><strong>物理学Physics</strong></p><p>Structured electrons with chiral mass and charge</p><p>具有手性质量和电荷的结构电子</p><p>▲ 作者：YIQI FANG, JOEL KUTTRUFF, DAVID NABBEN, AND PETER BAUM</p><p>▲链接：</p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp9143">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp9143</a></p><p>▲摘要：</p><p>手性是一种在基础物理学、材料科学、化学、光学和光谱学中具有广泛关联的现象。</p><p>这项工作中，研究组证明了自由电子可通过激光场周期转化为质量和电荷的右旋或左旋。与相位涡旋光束相比，该电子保持了平坦的德布罗意波，但从其时空期望值的形状获得了相应的手性。</p><p>通过阿秒门控测量波函数密度，揭示了具有左旋或右旋螺距的线圈和双线圈的三维形状。具有此类或相关手性几何结构的工程基本粒子可应用于手性传感、自由电子量子光学、粒子物理学或电子显微镜等领域。</p><p>▲ Abstract：</p><p>Chirality is a phenomenon with widespread relevance in fundamental physics, material science, chemistry, optics, and spectroscopy. In this work, we show that a free electron can be converted by the field cycles of laser light into a right-handed or left-handed coil of mass and charge. In contrast to phase-vortex beams, our electrons maintained a flat de Broglie wave but obtained their chirality from the shape of their expectation value in space and time. Measurements of wave function densities by attosecond gating revealed the three-dimensional shape of coils and double coils with left-handed or right-handed pitch.

We implemented a partitioning polar-slush strategy in RFEs to push the boundary of Ue. Guided by phase-field simulations, we designed and fabricated high-performance Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O3-SrTiO3–based RFE films with isolated slush-like polar clusters, which were realized through suppression of the nonpolar cubic matrix and introduction of highly insulating networks. The simultaneous enhancement of the reversible polarization and breakdown strength leads to a Ue of 202 joules per cubic centimeter with a high efficiency of ~79%.

Almost all current global chemistry models calculate about 15% too much OH and thus too rapid methane loss. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer, critical to achieving global warming targets, and this error affects our model projections of climate change. New observations of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet region (290 to 350 nanometers) imply reductions in sunlight with key photolysis rates decreasing by 8 to 12% in the near-surface tropical atmosphere. Incorporation of this new mechanism in a chemistry-transport model reduces OH and methane loss by only 4%, but combined with other proposed mechanisms, such as tropospheric halogen chemistry (7%), we may be able to resolve this conundrum.</p><p>Programmed alternating current optimization of Cu-catalyzed C-H bond transformations</p><p>铜催化C-H键转化的可编程交流电优化</p><p>▲ 作者：LI ZENG, QINGHONG YANG, JIANXING WANG, XIN WANG, PENGJIE WANG, SHENGCHUN WANG, ET AL.</p><p>▲链接：</p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado0875">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado0875</a></p><p>▲摘要：</p><p>直流（DC）电合成技术在过去一个世纪里经历了不断的优化，在各种工业工艺中起着举足轻重的作用。交流（AC）电合成具有极性反转和周期性波动的特征，或有利于多种化学反应，但设备、原理和应用场景进展较慢。</p><p>在这项工作中，研究组介绍了一种可编程交流（pAC）电合成协议，可系统地调整电流、频率和占空比。代表性pAC波形的应用促进了在DC和化学氧化条件下表现不佳的交叉偶联和双官能化反应中的铜催化碳-氢键裂解。</p><p>此外，观察不同波形应用下的催化剂动态变化为人们提供了机理见解。</p><p>▲ Abstract：</p><p>Direct current (DC) electrosynthesis, which has undergone optimization over the past century, plays a pivotal role in a variety of industrial processes.

In this work, we introduce a protocol for programmed AC (pAC) electrosynthesis that systematically adjusts currents, frequencies, and duty ratios. The application of representative pAC waveforms facilitates copper-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage in cross-coupling and difunctionalization reactions that exhibit suboptimal performance under DC and chemical oxidation conditions.

The prevailing view is that in the free troposphere, new particles are formed predominantly in convective cloud outflows. We present another mechanism using global observations. We find that during stratospheric air intrusion events, the mixing of descending ozone-rich stratospheric air with more moist free tropospheric background results in elevated hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. Such mixing is most prevalent near the tropopause where the sulfur dioxide (SO2) mixing ratios are high. The combination of elevated SO2 and OH levels leads to enhanced sulfuric acid concentrations, promoting particle formation.

This powerful drive for water is common within mammals and ensures that our physiological need for water is met. In animals that hibernate, however, drinking and thirst are suppressed for months. Junkins et al. looked at this phenomenon in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, a well-studied hibernating rodent, and found that their months-long suppression of thirst comes even in the face of physiological indicators of fluid deficit. This suppression is mediated by reduced activity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which experience reduced function in winter.</p><p>Exposure to sugar rationing in the first 1000 days of life protected against chronic disease</p><p>出生后头1000天接受糖配给，可预防慢性疾病</p><p>作者：TADEJA GRACNER, CLAIRE BOONE, AND PAUL J.

Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, and consumption nearly doubled immediately after rationing ended. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced type 2 diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35 and 20% and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years, respectively.

Synthesis science breakthroughs have been key to the realization of quantum dot technologies, but important group III–group V semiconductors, including colloidal gallium arsenide (GaAs), still cannot be synthesized with existing approaches. The high-temperature molten salt colloidal synthesis introduced in this work enables the preparation of previously intractable colloidal materials. We directly nucleated and grew colloidal quantum dots in molten inorganic salts by harnessing molten salt redox chemistry and using surfactant additives for nanocrystal shape control. Synthesis temperatures above 425°C are critical for realizing photoluminescent GaAs quantum dots, which emphasizes the importance of high temperatures enabled by molten salt solvents. We generalize the methodology and demonstrate nearly a dozen III-V solid-solution nanocrystal compositions that have not been previously reported.</p><p>Topological grain boundary segregation transitions</p><p>拓扑晶界偏析相变</p><p>▲ 作者：VIVEK DEVULAPALLI, ENZE CHEN, TOBIAS BRINK, TIMOFEY FROLOV AND CHRISTIAN H.

We combined atomic resolution electron microscopy and atomistic simulations to discover that iron segregation to GBs in titanium stabilizes icosahedral units (“cages”) that form robust building blocks of distinct GB phases. Owing to their five-fold symmetry, the iron cages cluster and assemble into hierarchical GB phases characterized by a different number and arrangement of the constituent icosahedral units. Our advanced GB structure prediction algorithms and atomistic simulations validate the stability of these observed phases and the high excess of iron at the GB that is accommodated by the phase transitions.</p><p>Soft hydrogel semiconductors with augmented biointeractive functions</p><p>软水凝胶半导体可增强生物交互功能</p><p>▲ 作者：YAHAO DAI, SHINYA WAI, PENGJU LI, NAISONG SHAN, ZHIQIANG CAO, YANG LI, ET AL.</p><p>▲链接：</p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp9314">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp9314</a></p><p>▲摘要：</p><p>水凝胶因其与生物组织的机械和化学相似性而闻名，广泛应用于生物技术，而半导体则提供先进的电子和光电功能，如信号放大、传感和光调制。将半导体特性与水凝胶设计相结合可以增强生物界面处的生物交互功能和亲密性，但由于聚合物半导体的亲水性较低，这很难实现。</p><p>研究组开发了一种溶剂亲和诱导组装方法，将不溶于水的聚合物半导体结合到双网络水凝胶中。这些半导体表现出软至81千帕的组织级模量、150%应变的拉伸率、高达1.4平方厘米&#x2F;伏&#x2F;秒的载流子迁移率。当其与生物组织结合时，该组织级模量可减轻免疫反应。</p><p>水凝胶的高孔隙度增强了半导体-生物流体界面的分子相互作用，从而实现了具有更高响应的光调制和具有更高灵敏度的体积生物传感。</p><p>▲ Abstract：</p><p>Hydrogels, known for their mechanical and chemical similarity to biological tissues, are widely used in biotechnologies, whereas semiconductors provide advanced electronic and optoelectronic functionalities such as signal amplification, sensing, and photomodulation. Combining semiconducting properties with hydrogel designs can enhance biointeractive functions and intimacy at biointerfaces, but this is challenging owing to the low hydrophilicity of polymer semiconductors. We developed a solvent affinity–induced assembly method that incorporates water-insoluble polymer semiconductors into double-network hydrogels. These semiconductors exhibited tissue-level moduli as soft as 81 kilopascals, stretchability of 150% strain, and charge-carrier mobility up to 1.4 square centimeters per volt per second. When they are interfaced with biological tissues, their tissue-level modulus enables alleviated immune reactions. The hydrogel’s high porosity enhances molecular interactions at semiconductor-biofluid interfaces, resulting in photomodulation with higher response and volumetric biosensing with higher sensitivity.</p><p><strong>能源科学Energy Science</strong></p><p>Unification of insertion and supercapacitive storage concepts: Storage profiles in titania</p><p>插入式储能和超级电容储能概念的统一：二氧化钛中的储能概况</p><p>▲ 作者：CHUANLIAN XIAO, HONGGUANG WANG, ROBERT USISKIN, PETER A.

Using tailored experiments on titanium oxide thin films of various thicknesses, we demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of both processes. For the interpretation of the entire storage profile encompassing both contributions, the (free) energies of the charge carriers in the mixed conductor and the neighboring phase are the only materials parameters required. The experimental results enable no less than a unification of insertion and supercapacitive storage, the first being dominant for thick films, the latter for thin films or negligible electronic conductivity. Therefore, the size of the storage medium and the nature of the current collecting phases can be used to tune power density versus energy density.</p><p><strong>地球科学Earth Science</strong></p><p>The fastest-growing and most destructive fires in the US (2001 to 2020)</p><p>美国增长最快、最具破坏性的火灾（2001~2020年）</p><p>▲ 作者：JENNIFER K.

Microplastics arise from multiple sources, including tires, textiles, cosmetics, paint, and the fragmentation of larger items. They are widely distributed throughout the natural environment, with evidence of harm at multiple levels of biological organization. They are pervasive in food and drink and have been detected throughout the human body, with emerging evidence of negative effects. Environmental contamination could double by 2040, and wide-scale harm has been predicted. Public concern is increasing, and diverse measures to address microplastic pollution are being considered in international negotiations. Clear evidence on the efficacy of potential solutions is now needed to address the issue and to minimize the risks of unintended consequences.</p></blockquote><p>百度网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1578qKxm-AlDnPJsTAK-eRw?pwd=7vzk">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1578qKxm-AlDnPJsTAK-eRw?pwd=7vzk</a><br>提取码：7vzk </p><p>夸克网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/a2a29b345a02">https://pan.quark.cn/s/a2a29b345a02</a></p><h3 id="0003-《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期"><a href="#0003-《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期" class="headerlink" title="0003_《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期"></a>0003_《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期</h3><p>通过百度网盘分享的文件：0003_《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zqek-JVYfv0ZwhxPb6JMeQ?pwd=j1yd">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zqek-JVYfv0ZwhxPb6JMeQ?pwd=j1yd</a><br>提取码：j1yd<br>–来自百度网盘超级会员V9的分享</p><p>我用夸克网盘分享了「0003_《科学》期刊，2024年11月01日，第6721期」，点击链接即可保存。打开「夸克APP」，无需下载在线播放视频，畅享原画5倍速，支持电视投屏。<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/6b98465a60b4">https://pan.quark.cn/s/6b98465a60b4</a></p><h3 id="0004-《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期"><a href="#0004-《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期" class="headerlink" title="0004_《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期"></a>0004_《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期</h3><p>通过百度网盘分享的文件：0004_《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KiOFJmznGdcp6H4my8cKTA?pwd=4o4c">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KiOFJmznGdcp6H4my8cKTA?pwd=4o4c</a><br>提取码：4o4c<br>–来自百度网盘超级会员V9的分享</p><p>我用夸克网盘分享了「0004_《科学》期刊，2024年11月08日，第6722期」，点击链接即可保存。打开「夸克APP」，无需下载在线播放视频，畅享原画5倍速，支持电视投屏。<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/6acc2ef36e16">https://pan.quark.cn/s/6acc2ef36e16</a></p><h3 id="0005-《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期"><a href="#0005-《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期" class="headerlink" title="0005_《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期"></a>0005_《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期</h3><p>通过百度网盘分享的文件：0005_《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/10Rliodix8kD_5kEVqnt1Bg?pwd=x6kl">https://pan.baidu.com/s/10Rliodix8kD_5kEVqnt1Bg?pwd=x6kl</a><br>提取码：x6kl<br>–来自百度网盘超级会员V9的分享</p><p>我用夸克网盘分享了「0005_《科学》期刊，2024年10月11日，第6718期」，点击链接即可保存。打开「夸克APP」，无需下载在线播放视频，畅享原画5倍速，支持电视投屏。<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/ab7a3aa7854b">https://pan.quark.cn/s/ab7a3aa7854b</a></p><h3 id="0006-《科学》期刊，2024年11月15日，第6723期"><a href="#0006-《科学》期刊，2024年11月15日，第6723期" class="headerlink" title="0006_《科学》期刊，2024年11月15日，第6723期"></a>0006_《科学》期刊，2024年11月15日，第6723期</h3><blockquote><p>《科学》（20241115出版）一周论文导读</p><p>编译|冯维维</p><p>Science, 15 November 2024, Volume 386, Issue 6723</p><p>《科学》2024年11月15日，第386卷，6723期</p><p><img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/80/v2-6ffadebcd847231af563a144a50575a9_1440w.webp" alt="image"></p><p><strong>化学Chemistry</strong></p><p>Detection of interstellar 1-cyanopyrene: A four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</p><p>星际四环多环芳烃1—氰芘的检测</p><p>▲ 作者：GABI WENZEL, ILSA R.

Infrared emission bands show that PAHs are abundant in space, but only a few specific PAHs have been detected in the interstellar medium. We detected 1-cyanopyrene, a cyano-substituted derivative of the related four-ring PAH pyrene, in radio observations of the dense cloud TMC-1, using the Green Bank Telescope. The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is ~ 1.52×1012cm-2, from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene.

Our model results indicate that 71 million to 95 million people in the conterminous United States potentially rely on groundwater with detectable concentrations of PFAS for their drinking water supplies before any treatment.</p></blockquote><p>百度网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rgHxfa0mSvOXKIYrml6S1w?pwd=bra7">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rgHxfa0mSvOXKIYrml6S1w?pwd=bra7</a><br>提取码：bra7 </p><p>夸克网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/c156f70a5cb3">https://pan.quark.cn/s/c156f70a5cb3</a></p><p><img src="/004_%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E6%9D%82%E5%BF%97/67431a74e4b03b5da6d1b4b2.webp" alt="img"></p><p>202446</p><p>百度网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1n3elei-1m03GqAdKNbr6vg?pwd=fymk">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1n3elei-1m03GqAdKNbr6vg?pwd=fymk</a><br>提取码：fymk </p><p>夸克网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/df79efcd1280">https://pan.quark.cn/s/df79efcd1280</a></p><p>我用夸克网盘分享了「202446」，点击链接即可保存。打开「夸克APP」，无需下载在线播放视频，畅享原画5倍速，支持电视投屏。<br>链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/df79efcd1280">https://pan.quark.cn/s/df79efcd1280</a></p><h3 id="Science-20241122"><a href="#Science-20241122" class="headerlink" title="Science-20241122"></a>Science-20241122</h3><blockquote><p>《科学》（20241122出版）一周论文导读</p><p>编译|李言</p><p>Science, 22 NOV 2024, Volume 386 Issue 6724</p><p>《科学》2024年11月22日，第386卷，6724期<br><img src="/004_%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E6%9D%82%E5%BF%97/67431a74e4b03b5da6d1b4b2-17333817527142.webp" alt="image"></p><p><strong>化学物理Chemical Physics</strong></p><p>Ultrafast all-optical coherence of molecular electron spins in room-temperature water solution</p><p>室温水溶液中分子电子自旋的超快全光相干性</p><p>▲ 作者：ERICA SUTCLIFFE, NATHANAEL P.

In this work, we report the noncovalent synthesis of unprecedented plastics that are mechanically strong yet metabolizable under biologically relevant conditions owing to their dissociative nature with electrolytes. Salt-bridging sodium hexametaphosphate with di- or tritopic guanidinium sulfate in water forms a cross-linked supramolecular network, which is stable unless electrolytes are resupplied. This unusual stability is caused by a liquid-liquid phase separation that expels sodium sulfate, generated upon salt bridging, into a water-rich phase. Drying the remaining condensed liquid phase yields glassy plastics that are thermally reshapable, such as thermoplastics, and usable even in aqueous media with hydrophobic parylene C coating. This approach can be extended to polysaccharide-based supramolecular plastics that are applicable for three-dimensional printing.</p><p><strong>地球科学Earth Sciences</strong></p><p>Ship collision risk threatens whales across the world’s oceans</p><p>船舶碰撞风险威胁全球海洋里的鲸鱼</p><p>▲ 作者：ANNA C.

We compiled a dataset of 435,000 whale locations to generate global distribution models for four globally ranging species. We then combined &gt;35 billion positions from 176,000 ships to produce a global estimate of whale-ship collision risk. Shipping occurs across 92% of whale ranges, and &lt;7% of risk hotspots contain management strategies to reduce collisions. Full coverage of hotspots could be achieved by expanding management over only 2.6% of the ocean’s surface. These inferences support the continued recovery of large whales against the backdrop of a rapidly growing shipping industry.</p><p><strong>生物学Biology</strong></p><p>Reconstruction of the human amylase locus reveals ancient duplications seeding modern-day variation</p><p>重建人类淀粉酶位点揭示了古代基因拷贝是现代变异的起源</p><p>▲ 作者：FEYZA YILMAZ, CHARIKLEIA KARAGEORGIOU et al.</p><p>▲链接：</p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn0609">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn0609</a></p><p>▲摘要：</p><p>我们在98名现代人中以核苷酸分辨率鉴定了30种结构上不同的单倍型，揭示了AMY1拷贝的编码序列在负选择下进化。对古人类和古人类基因组中这些单倍型的基因组分析表明，一种可以追溯到80万年前的常见三拷贝单倍型，通过反复出现的非等位基因同源重组，促使快速演化的重排。</p><p>此外，在过去的4000年里，AMY1拷贝数超过3个的单倍型在欧洲农民中出现的频率显著增加，这可能是对淀粉消化增加的适应性响应。</p><p>▲ Abstract：</p><p>We identified 30 structurally distinct haplotypes at nucleotide resolution among 98 present-day humans, revealing that the coding sequences of AMY1 copies are evolving under negative selection. Genomic analyses of these haplotypes in archaic hominins and ancient human genomes suggest that a common three-copy haplotype, dating as far back as 800,000 years ago, has seeded rapidly evolving rearrangements through recurrent nonallelic homologous recombination. Additionally, haplotypes with more than three AMY1 copies have significantly increased in frequency among European farmers over the past 4000 years, potentially as an adaptive response to increased starch digestion.</p><p><strong>动物学Zoology</strong></p><p>Direct hearing measurements in a baleen whale suggest ultrasonic sensitivity</p><p>须鲸的直接听力测量表明它对超声波很敏感</p><p>▲ 作者：DORIAN S.

In 2023, two minke whales provided measures of the auditory brainstem response and data on the frequency range of their hearing. Results show that minke whales are sensitive to sound frequencies as high as 45 to 90 kilohertz.

To trace cultural transmission among the four chimpanzee subspecies, we compared population networks based on genetic markers of recent migration and shared cultural traits. We show that limited levels of group connectivity favored the emergence of a few instances of cumulative culture in chimpanzees. As in humans, cultural complexification likely happened in steps, with transmission between populations, incremental changes, and repurposing of technologies. We propose that divergence in social patterns led to increased mobility between groups in the genus Homo, resulting in irreversible dependence on cultural exchange and complexification.</p></blockquote><p>百度网盘链接: <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HxJtA4iooOT5dM_1bYAkjw?pwd=4qma">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HxJtA4iooOT5dM_1bYAkjw?pwd&#x3D;4qma</a> 提取码: 4qma </p><p>夸克网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/61b7cb59807c">https://pan.quark.cn/s/61b7cb59807c</a></p><h2 id="电脑报"><a href="#电脑报" class="headerlink" title="电脑报"></a>电脑报</h2><h3 id="202447"><a href="#202447" class="headerlink" title="202447"></a>202447</h3><p>百度网盘链接: <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LzcJ2XnYZo4XW-MAU64rpA?pwd=wngt">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LzcJ2XnYZo4XW-MAU64rpA?pwd=wngt</a>  提取码: wngt </p><p>夸克网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/89b1202b6aac">https://pan.quark.cn/s/89b1202b6aac</a></p><h3 id="202448"><a href="#202448" class="headerlink" title="202448"></a>202448</h3><p>百度网盘链接: <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QiNeqxOllIAYfPtN61fA2g?pwd=x2fi">https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QiNeqxOllIAYfPtN61fA2g?pwd=x2fi</a> 提取码: x2fi </p><p>夸克网盘链接：<a href="https://pan.quark.cn/s/bf8ba8ce3b6f">https://pan.quark.cn/s/bf8ba8ce3b6f</a></p>]]></content>

href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1AT411J7cH/">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1AT411J7cH/</a><br>奇乐编程学院 2022-07-11 14:43:53</p><h3 id="简介"><a href="#简介" class="headerlink" title="简介"></a>简介</h3><p>嗨大家好，我是罗斯，今天我们来讲一个最最强大的视频处理工具， <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> ，没有之一，几乎你能想到的所有功能，比如视频格式的转换，压缩拼接，添加水印，甚至包括声音的处理，录屏GIF动图的转换都可以用它来完成。</p><p>它本身是一个命令行工具，很尽量完全免费，所有平台通用。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105090424899.png" class="" title="image-20241105090424899"><p>正因为它是一个命令行工具，你可以很方便的在脚本中调用它，创建批处理，用来进行自动化等等。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105090511548.png" class="" title="image-20241105090511548"><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105090621522.png" class="" title="image-20241105090621522"><p>可能你之前没有听过他，但其实相当多的视频工具平台播放器都用到了， <strong>Ffmpeg</strong>  或者它的核心库，另外有些观众可能知道，我的视频都是用脚本剪辑的，渲染的部分自然也用到了它，所以今天我想跟大家介绍一下， <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 的基本用法和一些实用的小技巧。</p><h3 id="安装"><a href="#安装" class="headerlink" title="安装"></a>安装</h3><p>首先我们还是稍微啰嗦一下， <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 的下载和安装，大家也可以直接跳过这段，在Linux Mac下最简单的动作方式，还是使用包管理工具，但是在Windows下也可以用第三方的choco，scoop来安装等等。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105090940071.png" class="" title="image-20241105090940071"><p>否则大家可以去官网这里，我以Windows为例，选择最下面的这个地址，然后找到win64gpl shared（ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared.zip）这个文件。</p><blockquote><p><a

<strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 就是我们要用到的命令。另外如果你希望在全局范围内，都可以调用到这个命令，那么还需要将bin目录的路径，添加到path环境变量中。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105092622932.png" class=""

title="小试牛刀"></a>小试牛刀</h3><p>配置完毕之后，我们先来小试牛刀一下，先来介绍一下 <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 最最基本的用法。</p><p>首先我们通过GUI指定输入文件的名字，然后在最后一个参数指定要输出的文件名，那么 <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 会自动根据扩展名转换，视频文件的格式。</p><blockquote><p>ffmpeg -i test.avi test.mp4</p><p>mpv test.mp4</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105091352018.png" class=""

src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105095836779.png" class="" title="image-20241105095836779"><p>编码解决的是如何将每一帧的画面存储成二进制的数据保存在硬盘上，或者通过网络传输。显然不同的编码，对于视频的质量和压缩率有很大的影响，对mp4文件，目前使用最广泛的视频编码是H264。</p><img

，也默认帮我们选择了H264编码。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105095947180.png" class="" title="image-20241105095947180"><p>当然我们可以通过更新冒号V，去手动指定一个视频编码器，这里的lb x264，其实就是 <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 默认提供的一个，用纯软件实现的H264编码器，如果你使用的是NVIDIA显卡的话，还可以用nb encoder进行硬件加速，这里我做了一个简单的时间比较，分别用lb x264和nb encoder，对同一段视频进行编码，可以看到第二种明显快了不少，所以如果你显卡支持的话，还是建议首选NBENCODER，因为它可以帮你节省不少时间。</p><blockquote><p>timeit ffmpeg -i test.avi -loglevel error -c:v libx264 output.mp4 -y</p><p>timeit ffmpeg -i test.avi

-i sound.wav sound.mp3</p></blockquote><p>，甚至可以用它来转换图片， 或者更常见的用法是用它来提取视频中的缩略图等等，这个我们待会讲到。  </p><blockquote><p>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -vf “fps&#x3D;1&#x2F;10,scale&#x3D;-2:720” thumbnail-%3d.jpg</p></blockquote><h4 id="preset"><a href="#preset" class="headerlink" title="preset"></a>preset</h4><p>另外在转换视频的时候，我们可以设置一些其他的参数，来压缩视频文件的大小，比如对于H264编码器，我们可以设置一个预设preset，它可以是下面这些取值。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105110629841.png" class=""

class="headerlink" title="过滤器"></a>过滤器</h4><p>说完了脚本的格式转换之后，我们来讲一下FFPX中另一个重要的功能过滤器。过滤器可以对视频图像进行变换，比如修改它的尺寸，裁剪旋转，添加滤镜等等，并且我们可以去指定一系列的过滤器，前一个过滤器的输出，会直接作为下一个过滤器的输入。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105110826333.png" class="" title="image-20241105110826333"><h5 id="缩放"><a href="#缩放" class="headerlink" title="缩放"></a>缩放</h5><p>比如我们可以将视频先缩放为原先的0.5倍，然后再将它旋转90度，这里我们用参数杠VF来指定一个过滤器，如果要修改视频的尺寸，我们可以用scale，后面我们输入缩放之后的长度和宽度，中间以冒号分隔</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105111008300.png" class="" title="image-20241105111008300"><p>我们也可以将其中任意一个参数设置为-2，让 <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 根据另外一个参数帮我们自动推算。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105110946181.png" class="" title="image-20241105110946181"><p>比如想将视频转化为720P，那么可以简写为-2冒号720。</p><h5 id="旋转"><a href="#旋转" class="headerlink" title="旋转"></a>旋转</h5><p>如果要旋转视频，我们可以用另一个过滤器，transpose后面的数字代表旋转的方向，我们可以在文档中看到，这里的2代表将视频90度逆时针旋转。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105111113777.png" class="" title="image-20241105111113777"><p>当然不同的过滤器可以相互组合，比如我们可以先缩放再旋转，我们只需要将它们以逗号分隔即可。</p><blockquote><p>ffmpeg -i test.avi -c:v libx264 -vf “scale&#x3D;256:256,transpose&#x3D;1” output.mp4</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105111223522.png" class="" title="image-20241105111223522"><h5 id="裁剪"><a href="#裁剪" class="headerlink" title="裁剪"></a>裁剪</h5><p>如果我们想要裁剪视频中的某一块区域，可以用到另一个过滤器crop，这里的四个数字分别代表区域的宽和高，以及左上角的XY坐标，另外他们也可以是一个表达式，比如我们可以将宽高设为1&#x2F;3，原始视频的宽度和高度，这里的iw根据名字可以猜到，它代表输出视频的宽度。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105113931767.png" class="" title="image-20241105113931767"><p>除了之前讲到的这三种过滤器之外，我们还可以在文档中找到其他上百种的过滤器，它们的用法都一样，首先通过参数 <strong>-vf</strong> 指定一个视频过滤器，然后输入过滤器的名字加等号，后面指定不同的参数参数之间用冒号分隔。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105114613330.png" class="" title="image-20241105114613330"><img

class="headerlink" title="剪切与合并"></a>剪切与合并</h5><p>接下来我们来讲一下， <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 对视频的剪切与合并，如果要剪切出视频的某个片段，我们会用到两个参数，第一个 <strong>-ss</strong> 指定了片段的起始位置，第二个 <strong>-t</strong> 表示片段的时长，这里我们可以用十分秒的格式，也可以直接填写描述，但需要注意的是，**-ss** 需要放在 <strong>-t</strong> 参数的后面，这样才能做到分毫不差的剪切。如果将 <strong>-ss</strong> 放在 -t 参数之前，我们虽然可以快速定位片段的起点，但由于使用的是关键帧定位，所以剪切的起始位置可能会稍有偏差。这种方式呢比较适合于较长的视频，因为定位的速度很快，另外我们可以用 <strong>-to</strong> 来替代 <strong>-t</strong> ，指定一个片段的中止位置，这两个参数都可以用于指定片段的时间范围，只不过表示的方式不同而已。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105115057062.png" class="" title="image-20241105115057062"><p>如果要合并视频的话，我们需要先将所有的文件列举在一个，文本文档中，使用下面这种格式，然后通过 <strong>-f concat</strong> 指定，接下来要输入的文件是一个视频列表，后面的 <strong>-i</strong> 传入了这个列表，文件在后面的 <strong>-c copy</strong> 代表我们不希望重新编码，而是直接拷贝原始视频的数据，因为我们输出的视频格式是完全一样的，重新编码自然会浪费很多时间。</p><blockquote><p>ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp4</p></blockquote><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105115228967.png" class="" title="image-20241105115228967"><h5 id="音频过滤器"><a href="#音频过滤器" class="headerlink" title="音频过滤器"></a>音频过滤器</h5><p>和视频过滤器一样，我们同样可以用过滤器对音频进行处理，不过这次我们用到的是GIF参数， <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> ，对音频的支持同样是相当齐全的，比如我们可以用volume来调节音量的大小，用LOL来统一视频的音量，添加高通低通滤波器甚至均衡器等等。</p><blockquote><p>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -af “volume&#x3D;1.5” output.mp4<br>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -af “loudnorm&#x3D;I&#x3D;-5:LRA&#x3D;A” output.mp4<br>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -af “equalizer&#x3D;f&#x3D;1000:width_type&#x3D;h:width&#x3D;200:g&#x3D;-10” output.mp4</p></blockquote><p>有时候我们还希望删除视频中的音频轨，比如创建一个无声的视频，那么可以用到 <strong>-an</strong> 参数类似的 <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> ，还提供 <strong>-vn</strong>， <strong>-sn</strong>， <strong>-dn</strong>，分别用来删除视频轨、字幕，还有数据流等等。</p><img src="/2024/11/05/FFmpeg%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8/image-20241105115739996.png" class="" title="image-20241105115739996"><p>到这里呢我们就讲完了， <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> 最最基本的概念和用法，在视频的最后，我想给大家介绍一些比较实用的小技巧。</p><h3 id="小技巧"><a href="#小技巧" class="headerlink" title="小技巧"></a>小技巧</h3><h4 id="创建缩略图"><a href="#创建缩略图" class="headerlink" title="创建缩略图"></a>创建缩略图</h4><p>首先第一个创建视频的缩略图，这里用到了两个过滤器，第一个 <strong>fps</strong> 指定了输出文件的帧率，1&#x2F;10代表每十秒输出一帧画面，而后面的 <strong>scale</strong> 指定了输出图像的大小，最后是图片的文件名，由thumbnail加上编号组成，格式为jpg。</p><blockquote><p>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -vf “fps&#x3D;1&#x2F;10, scale&#x3D;-2:720” thumbnail-%03d.jpg</p></blockquote><p>这个命令会在当前目录下输出，若干张视频的缩略图</p><h4 id="添加水印"><a href="#添加水印" class="headerlink" title="添加水印"></a>添加水印</h4><p>第二个技巧给视频添加水印，我们需要先准备一张图片，然后将原始视频和水印图片同时输入给 <strong>Ffmpeg</strong> ，后面的过滤器，overlay用于将水印叠加在原始视频的上面，在后面的这两个参数，指定了水印在图像中的位置</p><blockquote><p>ffmpeg -i test.mp4 -i cat.jpg -filter_complex “overlay&#x3D;100:100” output.mp4</p></blockquote><h4 id="GIF动图的转换"><a href="#GIF动图的转换" class="headerlink" title="GIF动图的转换"></a>GIF动图的转换</h4><p>第三个技巧，GIF动图的转换，由于GIF自身编码格式的限制，不太适合于较大或者较长的视频，所以我们需要先剪切出一个片段，然后用过滤器播放视频，并且降低视频的帧率，最后这部分的纯粹是，因为GIF自身256色的限制，因此需要单独创建一个调色板，运行命令可以帮我们生成一个高质量的GIF动图。</p><figure

Instead, you’ll be taking part in a phone interview, the results of which will determine whether you’re invited to meet with company representatives in person.</p><p>Many companies use phone interviews as an initial employment screening technique for a variety of reasons. Because they’re generally brief, phone interviews save companies time. They also serve as a more realistic screening alternative for cases in which companies are considering out-of-town (or out-of-province and foreign) candidates.</p><p>So the chances are pretty good that, at some point in your job hunt, you’ll be asked to participate in a 20- to 30-minute phone interview with either one person or several people on the other end of the line. In many ways, the way you prepare for a phone interview isn’t all that different from the way you’d get ready for a face-to-face interview – save for a few slight additions to and modifications of your list of preparation tasks.</p><p>Here’s what to do:</p><p><strong>1. Treat the phone interview seriously, just as you would a face-to-face interview.</strong></p><p>A phone interview seems so informal on the surface that it can be easy to fall into the trap of “phoning it in” – i.e., not preparing for it as well as you would for an in-person interview. Don’t get caught with your guard down. Be sure to research the company, study the job description, and practice your responses to anticipated questions, just as you would for any other interview.</p><p><strong>2. Have your resume and cover letter in front of you.</strong></p><p>You’ll almost certainly be asked about some of the information that appears on these documents. You might also want to have in front of you any supporting materials that relate to information in your resume and cover letter, like documents you’ve designed or written, a portfolio of your various projects, or the written position description from your past positions.</p><p><strong>3. Make a cheat sheet.</strong></p><p>Jot down a few notes about the most critical points you want to make with your interviewer(s). Are there certain skills and experiences you want to emphasize? Do you have certain interests or passions you want your interviewer(s) to know about and understand? Be sure these pieces of information appear on your crib sheet. Then touch on them during the interview, even if your only chance to do so is at the end of the session when the interviewer asks you if you have any questions or anything to add.</p><p><strong>4. Get a high-quality phone.</strong></p><p>This isn’t the time to use a cell phone that cuts in and out, or a cheaply made phone that makes it difficult for you and your interviewer(s) to hear and understand each other.</p><p><strong>5. Shower, groom and dress up (at least a little).</strong></p><p>Odd advice? Perhaps. But focusing on your appearance, just as you would for a normal interview, will put you in the right frame of mind from a psychological standpoint. You won’t do as well in your phone interview if you’re lying in bed, for example, or if you’re draped over your couch in your pajamas.</p><p><strong>6. Stand up, or at least sit up straight at a table or desk.</strong></p><p>Again, there’s a psychological, frame of mind aspect to consider here. But on a more tangible level, research has shown that you project yourself better when you’re standing up, and you’ll feel more knowledgeable and confident.</p><p>Phone interviews can be tricky, especially since you aren’t able to read your interviewers’ nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language during the session – a big difference from the typical interview. But if you prepare well for your phone interview, you won’t need to read anyone’s nonverbals to gauge your performance. You’ll know for sure how you’ve done because you’ll be invited to <a href="https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/different-types-of-interviews-canada">a face-to-face interview</a>, where you’ll have yet another opportunity to prove you’re the best person for the job.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You just got word that you landed a job interview with a company that really interests you – only there’s a slight catch.<br>你刚刚收到消息说你得到了一家你真正感兴趣的公司的面试机会——只是有一个小问题。</p><p>You won’t be meeting with your interviewer(s) face to face. Instead, you’ll be taking part in a phone interview, the results of which will determine whether you’re invited to meet with company representatives in person.<br>您不会与面试官面对面会面。相反，您将参加电话面试，面试结果将决定您是否被邀请与公司代表亲自会面。</p><p>Many companies use phone interviews as an initial employment screening technique for a variety of reasons. Because they’re generally brief, phone interviews save companies time. They also serve as a more realistic screening alternative for cases in which companies are considering out-of-town (or out-of-province and foreign) candidates.<br>出于多种原因，许多公司使用电话面试作为初次就业筛选技术。由于电话面试通常很简短，因此可以节省公司的时间。对于公司正在考虑外地（或省外和外国）候选人的情况，它们还可以作为更现实的筛选替代方案。</p><p>So the chances are pretty good that, at some point in your job hunt, you’ll be asked to participate in a 20- to 30-minute phone interview with either one person or several people on the other end of the line. In many ways, the way you prepare for a phone interview isn’t all that different from the way you’d get ready for a face-to-face interview – save for a few slight additions to and modifications of your list of preparation tasks.<br>因此，很有可能，在您找工作的某个时刻，您会被要求参加一个 20 到 30 分钟的电话面试，面试对象可能是电话另一端的一个人，也可能是几个人。在很多方面，准备电话面试的方式与准备面对面面试的方式并没有什么不同——除了对准备清单进行一些细微的补充和修改之外任务。</p><p>Here’s what to do:<br>该怎么做：</p><p><strong>1. Treat the phone interview seriously, just as you would a face-to-face interview.</strong><br><strong>1. 认真对待电话面试，就像对待面对面面试一样。</strong></p><p>A phone interview seems so informal on the surface that it can be easy to fall into the trap of “phoning it in” – i.e., not preparing for it as well as you would for an in-person interview. Don’t get caught with your guard down. Be sure to research the company, study the job description, and practice your responses to anticipated questions, just as you would for any other interview.<br>电话面试表面上看起来非常非正式，很容易陷入“打电话面试”的陷阱——也就是说，没有像面对面面试那样做好准备。不要放松警惕。一定要研究公司，研究职位描述，并练习对预期问题的回答，就像任何其他面试一样。</p><p><strong>2. Have your resume and cover letter in front of you.</strong><br><strong>2. 将您的简历和求职信放在您的面前。</strong></p><p>You’ll almost certainly be asked about some of the information that appears on these documents. You might also want to have in front of you any supporting materials that relate to information in your resume and cover letter, like documents you’ve designed or written, a portfolio of your various projects, or the written position description from your past positions.<br>几乎肯定会询问您这些文档中出现的一些信息。您可能还需要准备与简历和求职信中的信息相关的任何支持材料，例如您设计或编写的文件、各种项目的组合或您过去职位的书面职位描述。</p><p><strong>3. Make a cheat sheet.</strong><br><strong>3. 制作备忘单。</strong></p><p>Jot down a few notes about the most critical points you want to make with your interviewer(s). Are there certain skills and experiences you want to emphasize? Do you have certain interests or passions you want your interviewer(s) to know about and understand? Be sure these pieces of information appear on your crib sheet. Then touch on them during the interview, even if your only chance to do so is at the end of the session when the interviewer asks you if you have any questions or anything to add.<br>记下一些关于您想向面试官提出的最关键观点的笔记。您想强调某些技能和经验吗？您是否有某些兴趣或热情希望面试官了解和理解？确保这些信息出现在您的备忘单上。然后在面试过程中触及它们，即使你唯一的机会是在面试结束时面试官问你是否有任何问题或有什么要补充的时候。</p><p><strong>4. Get a high-quality phone.</strong><br><strong>4. 买一部高质量的手机。</strong></p><p>This isn’t the time to use a cell phone that cuts in and out, or a cheaply made phone that makes it difficult for you and your interviewer(s) to hear and understand each other.<br>现在不是使用断断续续的手机或廉价手机的时候，因为这会让你和面试官很难听到和理解对方的声音。</p><p><strong>5. Shower, groom and dress up (at least a little).</strong><br><strong>5. 淋浴、打扮和打扮（至少一点点）。</strong></p><p>Odd advice? Perhaps. But focusing on your appearance, just as you would for a normal interview, will put you in the right frame of mind from a psychological standpoint. You won’t do as well in your phone interview if you’re lying in bed, for example, or if you’re draped over your couch in your pajamas.<br>奇怪的建议？也许。但是，就像在正常面试中一样，关注自己的外表，从心理学的角度来看，会让你处于正确的心态。例如，如果你躺在床上，或者穿着睡衣躺在沙发上，你在电话面试中的表现就不会那么好。</p><p><strong>6. Stand up, or at least sit up straight at a table or desk.</strong><br><strong>6. 站起来，或者至少在桌子或书桌前坐直。</strong></p><p>Again, there’s a psychological, frame of mind aspect to consider here. But on a more tangible level, research has shown that you project yourself better when you’re standing up, and you’ll feel more knowledgeable and confident.<br>同样，这里需要考虑心理、心态方面的因素。但在更具体的层面上，研究表明，当你站起来时，你可以更好地展现自己，你会感到更有知识和自信。</p><p>Phone interviews can be tricky, especially since you aren’t able to read your interviewers’ nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language during the session – a big difference from the typical interview. But if you prepare well for your phone interview, you won’t need to read anyone’s nonverbals to gauge your performance. You’ll know for sure how you’ve done because you’ll be invited to <a href="https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/different-types-of-interviews-canada">a face-to-face interview</a>, where you’ll have yet another opportunity to prove you’re the best person for the job.<br>电话面试可能很棘手，特别是因为你无法在面试过程中阅读面试官的非语言线索，例如面部表情和肢体语言，这与典型的面试有很大不同。但如果你为电话面试做好充分准备，你就不需要阅读任何人的非语言来衡量你的表现。您会确切地知道自己的表现，因为您将被邀请参加面对面的面试，在那里您将有另一个机会证明自己是该职位的最佳人选。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>crib </p><p>tricky</p><p>nonverbals</p><p>cues</p><p>facial expressions </p><p>gauge </p></blockquote><h1 id="END"><a href="#END" class="headerlink" title="END"></a>END</h1>]]></content>

They approach situations by determining the specifications of systems in question, analyzing workflows, and proposing software solutions to address wants and needs. They often work closely with vendors to obtain software licenses, test products, and approve solutions. Depending on the level of their position, software engineers may also work closely with managers or executives in order to establish or meet company goals.<br>软件工程师通过设计和创建软件解决方案为信息系统做出贡献。他们通过确定相关系统的规格、分析工作流程并提出软件解决方案来满足需求来处理情况。他们经常与供应商密切合作以获得软件许可证、测试产品和批准解决方案。根据职位级别，软件工程师还可能与经理或高管密切合作，以建立或实现公司目标。</p><p>A great software engineer resume should include a few essential components. First, list your responsibilities and accomplishments for each previous position while keeping in mind the job that you’re applying for. Discuss projects that you’ve completed while providing specifics about goals you’ve met. Mention languages and programs you’re familiar with to convey the skills you’ve acquired on the job. Since this position typically requires advanced problem-solving skills, be sure to communicate how you approach and address problems.<br>一份优秀的软件工程师简历应该包括一些重要的组成部分。首先，列出您之前每个职位的职责和成就，同时牢记您正在申请的工作。讨论您已完成的项目，同时提供有关您已实现的目标的具体信息。提及您熟悉的语言和程序，以传达您在工作中获得的技能。由于该职位通常需要高级的解决问题的技能，因此请务必传达您如何处理和解决问题。</p><p><strong>Common Mistakes for Software Engineer Resumes</strong><br><strong>软件工程师简历的常见错误</strong></p><p>When you’re compiling your software engineer resume, keep an eye out for some of the most common mistakes. One of the biggest errors that software engineers make is listing general accomplishments without providing specific numbers. Simply mentioning that you’ve created code and designed programs for a company isn’t enough to convey your true accomplishments. Instead, mention what you’ve accomplished, how you’ve done it, and what kind of impact the final product had.<br>当您编写软件工程师简历时，请留意一些最常见的错误。软件工程师犯的最大错误之一是列出一般成就而不提供具体数字。仅仅提及您为一家公司创建了代码并设计了程序并不足以传达您的真实成就。相反，提及你所取得的成就、你是如何做到的以及最终产品产生了什么样的影响。</p><p>Another common resume mistake that software engineers make is failing to specify their skill level. Most candidates already know how important it is to list programming language they know and relevant skills they’ve acquired, but software engineers at all skill levels neglect to indicate where they rank in terms of each area of expertise. Make it easy for potential employers to know where you stand by using terms like “beginner,” “intermediate” or “expert” when you mention languages and skills.<br>软件工程师在简历中犯的另一个常见错误是没有具体说明他们的技能水平。大多数候选人已经知道列出他们所知道的编程语言和他们所获得的相关技能是多么重要，但所有技能水平的软件工程师都忽略了他们在每个专业领域的排名。当您提到语言和技能时，使用“初学者”、“中级”或“专家”等术语，让潜在雇主更容易了解您的立场。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Software-Engineer-Resume-Sample-软件工程师简历样本"><a href="#Software-Engineer-Resume-Sample-软件工程师简历样本" class="headerlink" title="Software Engineer Resume Sample-软件工程师简历样本"></a>Software Engineer Resume Sample-软件工程师简历样本</h3><blockquote><p><strong>Liz Jones</strong><br><strong>莉兹·琼斯</strong><br>123 Main Parkway<br>123主干道<br>Vancouver, BC<br>不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华<br>123-456-789 | <a href="mailto:&#x6c;&#105;&#x7a;&#x6a;&#111;&#110;&#x65;&#115;&#64;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#49;&#50;&#51;&#45;&#x34;&#x35;&#x36;&#x2d;&#55;&#56;&#57;">&#x6c;&#105;&#x7a;&#x6a;&#111;&#110;&#x65;&#115;&#64;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#49;&#50;&#51;&#45;&#x34;&#x35;&#x36;&#x2d;&#55;&#56;&#57;</a> | 123-456-789 <a href="mailto:&#x6c;&#105;&#122;&#106;&#111;&#110;&#x65;&#x73;&#x40;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x6c;&#105;&#122;&#106;&#111;&#110;&#x65;&#x73;&#x40;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a></p><p>Work Experience<br>工作经验</p><p>2014 - Present2014年至今<br>Vancouver, BC不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华</p><p>Senior Software Engineer | Vancouver Tech Works<br>高级软件工程师|温哥华科技厂</p><ul><li>Use Hybrid Agile development methodology to maintain schedules for product development and testing<br>使用混合敏捷开发方法来维护产品开发和测试的时间表</li><li>Coordinate the efforts of a remote team of 12 members through frequent online communication<br>通过频繁的在线沟通协调由 12 名成员组成的远程团队的工作</li><li>Have applied strong sense of organization and leadership to reduce product development costs by 15 percent<br>运用强烈的组织意识和领导力，将产品开发成本降低了 15%</li></ul><p>2011 - 2014<br>Vancouver, BC<br>不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华</p><p>Software Engineer | BC Development<br>软件工程师| BC发展</p><ul><li>Designed standard frameworks to be reused in future projects<br>设计了可在未来项目中重用的标准框架</li><li>Drove larger software engineering team to adopt cutting-edge software application<br>推动更大的软件工程团队采用尖端的软件应用程序</li><li>Acted as liaison between project team and clients to translate client needs into achievable goals<br>作为项目团队和客户之间的联络人，将客户需求转化为可实现的目标</li></ul><p>2011 - 2012<br>Vancouver, BC<br>不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华</p><p>Web Developer | 123 TECH<br>网页开发人员 | 123 科技</p><ul><li>Created website for upcoming television network The ATLX<br>为即将推出的电视网络 The ATLX 创建网站</li><li>Designed, developed, implemented, and maintained three web applications for clients<br>为客户设计、开发、实施和维护三个 Web 应用程序</li><li>Analyzed user requirements, and translated client needs into application design<br>分析用户需求，并将客户需求转化为应用设计</li></ul><p>Education<br>教育</p><p>2005 - 2009<br>Calgary, AB<br>艾伯塔省卡尔加里</p><p>University of Calgary<br>卡尔加里大学<br><em>B.S.

They are formed using present participles (<em>going</em>, <em>reading</em>, <em>seeing</em>, <em>walking</em>, etc.), past participles (<em>gone</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>seen</em>, <em>walked</em>, etc.) or perfect participles (<em>having gone</em>, <em>having read</em>, <em>having seen</em>, <em>having walked</em>, etc.). 分词从句使我们能够以更经济的方式表达信息。它们由现在分词（going、reading、seeing、walking 等）、过去分词（gone、read、seeing、walking 等）或完成分词（having gone、having read、having see、having walk 等构成） .)。</p><p>We can use participle clauses when the participle and the verb in the main clause have the same subject. For example,当分词和主句中的动词具有相同的主语时，我们可以使用分词从句。例如，</p><blockquote><p><em>Waiting for Ellie, I made some tea.</em> (<em>While <strong>I</strong> was waiting for Ellie, <strong>I</strong> made some tea.</em>)  我泡了茶等待艾莉。 （在等艾莉的时候，我泡了一些茶。）</p></blockquote><p>Participle clauses do not have a specific tense. The tense is indicated by the verb in the main clause. 分词从句没有特定的时态。时态由主句中的动词表示。</p><p>Participle clauses are mainly used in written texts, particularly in a literary, academic or journalistic style. 分词从句主要用于书面文本，特别是文学、学术或新闻风格。</p><h4 id="Present-participle-clauses-现在分词从句"><a href="#Present-participle-clauses-现在分词从句" class="headerlink" title="Present participle clauses-现在分词从句"></a>Present participle clauses-现在分词从句</h4><p>Here are some common ways we use present participle clauses. Note that present participles have a similar meaning to active verbs. 以下是我们使用现在分词从句的一些常见方法。请注意，现在分词与主动动词具有相似的含义。</p><blockquote><ul><li>To give the result of an action给出动作的结果<br><em>The bomb exploded, <strong>destroying the building</strong>.炸弹爆炸，摧毁了建筑物。</em></li><li>To give the reason for an action给出采取行动的理由<br><em><strong>Knowing she loved reading</strong>, Richard bought her a book.理查德知道她喜欢读书，就给她买了一本书。</em></li><li>To talk about an action that happened at the same time as another action谈论与另一个动作同时发生的动作<br><em><strong>Standing in the queue</strong>, I realised I didn’t have any money.站在队列里，我发现自己没有钱。</em></li><li>To add information about the subject of the main clause添加有关主句主语的信息<br><em><strong>Starting in the new year</strong>, the new policy bans cars in the city centre.从新年开始，新政策禁止汽车在市中心行驶。</em></li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="Past-participle-clauses-过去分词从句"><a href="#Past-participle-clauses-过去分词从句" class="headerlink" title="Past participle clauses-过去分词从句"></a>Past participle clauses-过去分词从句</h4><p>Here are some common ways that we use past participle clauses. Note that past participles normally have a passive meaning.以下是我们使用过去分词从句的一些常见方法。请注意，过去分词通常具有被动含义。</p><ul><li>With a similar meaning to an <em>if</em> condition与 if 条件的含义类似<br><em><strong>Used in this way</strong>, participles can make your writing more concise.这样使用分词可以使你的写作更加简洁。</em>(<em>If you use participles in this way, …</em> )（如果您以这种方式使用分词，…）</li><li>To give the reason for an action给出采取行动的理由<br><em><strong>Worried by the news</strong>, she called the hospital.听到这个消息，她很担心，于是给医院打电话。</em></li><li>To add information about the subject of the main clause添加有关主句主语的信息<br><em><strong>Filled with pride</strong>, he walked towards the stage.他满怀自豪地走向讲台。</em></li></ul><h4 id="Perfect-participle-clauses-完成分词从句"><a href="#Perfect-participle-clauses-完成分词从句" class="headerlink" title="Perfect participle clauses-完成分词从句"></a>Perfect participle clauses-完成分词从句</h4><p>Perfect participle clauses show that the action they describe was finished before the action in the main clause. Perfect participles can be structured to make an active or passive meaning.完美分词从句表明它们所描述的动作是在主句中的动作之前完成的。完美分词可以构成主动或被动的含义。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Having got dressed</strong>, he slowly went downstairs.穿好衣服，他缓缓下了楼。<br><strong>Having finished their training完成训练后</strong>, they will be fully qualified doctors.，他们将是完全合格的医生。<br><strong>Having been made redundant已被裁员</strong>, she started looking for a new job.，她开始寻找新工作。</em></p></blockquote><h4 id="Participle-clauses-after-conjunctions-and-prepositions-连词和介词后的分词从句"><a href="#Participle-clauses-after-conjunctions-and-prepositions-连词和介词后的分词从句" class="headerlink" title="Participle clauses after conjunctions and prepositions-连词和介词后的分词从句"></a>Participle clauses after conjunctions and prepositions-连词和介词后的分词从句</h4><p>It is also common for participle clauses, especially with <em>-ing</em>, to follow conjunctions and prepositions such as <em>before</em>, <em>after</em>, <em>instead of</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>since</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>while</em> and <em>in spite of</em>.分词从句（尤其是 -ing）跟在连词和介词后面也很常见，例如 before、after、rather of、on、since、when、while 和 inthough of。</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Before cooking</strong>, you should wash your hands. 做饭前，应该洗手。<br><strong>Instead of complaining about it而不是抱怨它</strong>, they should try doing something positive.，他们应该尝试做一些积极的事情。<br><strong>On arriving at the hotel抵达酒店后</strong>, he went to get changed.，他去换衣服了。<br><strong>While packing her things收拾东西的时候</strong>, she thought about the last two years.，她想起了这两年的事情。<br><strong>In spite of having read the instructions twice尽管已经阅读了两次说明</strong>, I still couldn’t understand how to use it.，我还是没明白怎么用。</em></p></blockquote><p>Do this exercise to test your grammar again.做这个练习来再次测试你的语法。</p><h3 id="Grammar-test-2-语法测试2"><a href="#Grammar-test-2-语法测试2" class="headerlink" title="Grammar test 2-语法测试2"></a>Grammar test 2-语法测试2</h3><h4 id="Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1"><a href="#Using-‘have’-and-‘have-got’-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2"></a>Using ‘have’ and ‘have got’: 2</h4><p>Choose the correct words.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>My grandfather ______ got a white beard.</li></ol></blockquote>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="\assets\css\APlayer.min.css"><script src="\assets\js\APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><h2 id="【C1-Listening】Bad-Smells-in-Code-代码里的坏味道"><a href="#【C1-Listening】Bad-Smells-in-Code-代码里的坏味道" class="headerlink" title="【C1-Listening】Bad Smells in Code-代码里的坏味道"></a>【C1-Listening】Bad Smells in Code-代码里的坏味道</h2><blockquote><p>Chapter 3: Bad Smells in Code<br>“If it stinks, change it.”</p><p>— Grandma Beck, discussing child raising philosophy By now you have a good idea of how refactoring works. But just because you know how doesn’t mean you know when. Deciding when to start refactoring (and when to stop) is just as important to refactoring as knowing how to operate the mechanics of a refactoring.</p><p>Now comes the dilemma. It is easy to explain to you how to delete an instance variable or create a hierarchy. These are simple matters. Trying to explain when you should do these things is not so cut-anddried. Rather than appealing to some vague notion of programming aesthetics (which frankly is what we consultants usually do) I wanted something a bit more solid.</p><p>I was mulling over this tricky issue when I visited Kent in Zurich. Perhaps he was under the influence of the odors of his new born daughter at the time, but he had come up with the notion describing the “when” of refactoring in terms of smells. “Smells,” you say, “and that is supposed to be better than vague aesthetics?” Well, yes. We look at lots of code, written by projects that span the gamut from wildly successful to nearly dead. And in doing so, we have learned to look for certain structures in the code that suggest (sometimes they scream for) the possibility of refactoring. (We are switching over to “we” in this chapter to reflect the fact that Kent and I wrote this chapter jointly. You can tell the difference because the funny jokes are mine and the others are his.)</p><p>One thing we won’t try to do here is give you precise criteria for when a refactoring is overdue. In our experience there is no set of metrics that rival informed human intuition. What we will do is give you indications that there is trouble that could be solved by a refactoring. You will have to develop your own sense of how many instance variables is too many instance variables and how many lines of code in a method is too many lines.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Duplicated-code"><a href="#Duplicated-code" class="headerlink" title="Duplicated code"></a>Duplicated code</h3><blockquote><p>Number one on the stink parade is duplicated code. If you see the same code structure in more than one place, you can be sure that your program will be better if you find a way to unify them.</p><p>The simplest duplicated code problem is when you have the same expression in two methods of the same class. Then all you have to do is Extract Method (114) and invoke the code from both places.</p><p>Another common duplication problem is when you have the same expression in two sibling subclasses. You can eliminate this duplication by using Extract Method (114) in both classes, then Pull Up Method (271). If the code is similar but not the same, then you need to use Extract Method (114) to separate the similar bits from the different bits.</p><p>You may then find you can use Form Template Method (289). If the methods do the same thing using a different algorithm, you can choose the clearer of the two algorithms and use Substitute Algorithm (132).</p><p>If you have duplicated code in two unrelated classes, consider using Extract Component (166) in one class, and then use the new component in the other. Another possibility is that the method really belongs only in one of the classes and should be invoked by the other class, or that the method belongs in a third class that should be referred to by both of the original classes. You have to decide where the method makes sense, and ensure it is there and nowhere else.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Long-method"><a href="#Long-method" class="headerlink" title="Long method"></a>Long method</h3><blockquote><p>The object programs that live best and longest are those with short methods. Programmers new to objects often get the feeling that no computation ever takes place, that object programs are endless sequences of delegation. When you have lived with a program for a few years, however, you learn just how valuable all those little methods are. All of the pay-offs of indirection- explanation, sharing, and choosing- are supported by little methods.</p><p>Since the early days of programming people have realized that the longer a procedure is, the more difficult it is to understand. Older languages carried an overhead in subroutine calls, which deterred people from small method, modern OO languages have pretty much eliminated that overhead. There is still an overhead to the reader of the code as you have to switch context to look and see what the sub-procedure does. Development environments that allow you to see two methods at once help to eliminate this; but the real key to making it easy to understand small methods is good naming. If you have a good name for a method you don’t need to look at the body.</p><p>The net effect of this is that you should be much more aggressive about decomposing methods. A heuristic we follow is whenever we feel the need to comment something, we instead write a method. Such a method contains the code that was commented, but is named after what the intention of the code is, rather than how it does it. We may do this on a group of lines, or on as small as a single line of code. We will do this even if the method call is longer than the code it replaces, providing the method name explains the purpose of the code. The key here is not the method length, but the semantic distance between what the method does and how it does it.</p><p>99% of the time, all you have to shorten a method is Extract Method (114). Find a part of the method that seems to go nicely together and make a new method.</p><p>If you have a method with lots of parameters and temporary variables, they get in the way of extracting methods. If you try to use Extract Method, you end up passing so many of the parameters and temporary variables as parameters to the extracted method that the result is scarcely more readable than the original. You can often use Inline Temp (121) to get rid of the temps. Long lists of parameters can be slimmed down with Introduce Parameter Object (247) and Preserve Whole Object (241).</p><p>If you’ve tried that, and you still have too many temps and parameters,<br>then it’s time to get out the heavy artillery: Replace Method with Method Object (130).</p><p>How do you identify the clumps of code to extract? A good technique is to look for comments. They often signal this kind of semantic distance.</p><p>A block of code with a comment that tells you what it is doing can be replaced by a method whose name is based on the comment.</p><p>Even a single line is worth extracting if it needs explanation.</p><p>Conditionals and loops also give signs for extractions. Use Decompose Conditional (136) to deal with conditional expressions. With loops extract the loop and the code within the loop into its own method.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Large-Class"><a href="#Large-Class" class="headerlink" title="Large Class"></a>Large Class</h3><blockquote><p>When a class is trying to do too much, it often shows up as too many instance variables. When a class has too many instance variables, duplicated code cannot be far behind.</p><p>You can Extract Component (166) to bundle up a number of the variables.</p><p>Choose variables to go together in the component that makes sense with each other. For example, “depositAmount” and “deposit-Currency” are likely to belong together in a component. More generally, common prefixes or suffixes for some subset of the variables in a class suggest the opportunity for a component. If the component makes sense as a subclass you’ll find Extract Subclass (277) often is easier.</p><p>However you can only do this if the subset of instance variables that are used do not change during an object’s lifetime.</p><p>Sometimes a class will not be using all of its instance variables all of the time. If so, you may be able to Extract Component (166) or Extract Subclass (277) many times.</p><p>As with a class with too many instance variables, a class with too much code is prime breeding ground for duplicated code, chaos, and death.</p><p>The simplest solution (have we mentioned that we like simple solutions?)</p><p>is if you can eliminate redundancy in the class itself. If you have five hundred line methods with lots of code in common, you may be able to turn them into five ten line methods with another ten two line methods extracted from the original.</p><p>As with a class with a huge wad of variables, the usual solution for a class with too much code is either to Extract Component (166) or Extract Subclass (277).</p></blockquote><h3 id="Long-Parameter-List"><a href="#Long-Parameter-List" class="headerlink" title="Long Parameter List"></a>Long Parameter List</h3><blockquote><p>In our early programming days we were taught to pass everything a routine needed in as parameters. This was understandable because the alternative was global data, and global data is evil and usually painful.</p><p>Objects change this situation because if you don’t have something you need, you can always ask another object to get it for you. Thus with objects you don’t pass in everything the method needs, instead you pass enough so that the method can get to everything it needs. A lot of what a method needs is available on method’s host class. Thus in object-oriented programs parameter lists tend to be much smaller than on traditional programs.</p><p>This is good because long parameter lists are hard to understand, they get inconsistent and difficult to use, and because you are forever changing them as you need more data. Most changes are removed by passing objects because you are much more likely to just need to make a couple of requests to get at a new piece of data.</p><p>Use Replace Parameter with Method (245) when you can get the data in one parameter by making a request of an object you already know about. This object might be a field or it might be another parameter.</p><p>Use Preserve Whole Object (241) to take a bunch of data gleaned from an object and replace it with the object itself. If you have several data items with no logical object, then Introduce Parameter Object (247).</p><p>There is one important exception to doing these changes. This is when you explicitly do not wish to create a dependency from the called object to the larger object. In those cases unpacking data and sending it along as parameters is reasonable, but pay attention to the pain involved. If the parameter list is too long or changes too often you will need to rethink your dependency structure.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Divergent-Change"><a href="#Divergent-Change" class="headerlink" title="Divergent Change"></a>Divergent Change</h3><blockquote><p>We structure our software to make change easier, after all software is meant to be soft. So when we make a change we want to be able to jump to a single clear point in the system and make the change.</p><p>If you look at a class and say, “Well, I will have to change these three methods every time I get a new database. I have to change these four methods every time there is a new financial instrument.” you likely have a situation where two objects are better than one. Of course you often discover this only after you’ve added a few databases or financial instruments. Any change to handle a variation should change a single class and all the typing in the new class should be expressing the variation.</p><p>So for this you identify those things you are changing and use Extract Component (166) to put them all together.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Shotgun-Surgery"><a href="#Shotgun-Surgery" class="headerlink" title="Shotgun Surgery"></a>Shotgun Surgery</h3><blockquote><p>You whiff this when every time you add some variation, you have to make a lot of little changes to a lot of different classes. When the changes are all over the place, they are hard to find, and it’s easy to miss an important change. In this case you want to use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) to get all the changes into a single class. If no current class looks like a good candidate, then create one.

Kent’s Self Delegation is another. You do these to combat the Divergent Change smell. The fundamental rule of thumb is to put things together that change together. Data and the behavior that references that data usually change together, but there are exceptions.<br>脑海中立即浮现出《四人帮》的策略和访客。肯特的自我委托是另一个例子。你这样做是为了对抗发散变化的味道。基本的经验法则是将变化的事物放在一起。数据和引用该数据的行为通常会一起更改，但也有例外。</p><p>When those exceptions occur we move the behavior to keep changes in one place. Strategy and Visitor allow you to change behavior easily because it isolates the small amount of behavior that needs to be overridden, at the cost of further indirection.<br>当这些异常发生时，我们会移动行为以将更改保留在一处。策略和访问者允许您轻松更改行为，因为它隔离了需要覆盖的少量行为，但代价是进一步间接。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Data-Clumps数据块"><a href="#Data-Clumps数据块" class="headerlink" title="Data Clumps数据块"></a>Data Clumps数据块</h3><blockquote><p>Data items tend to be like children — they enjoy hanging around in groups together. Often you’ll see the same three or four data items together in lots of places: fields in a couple of classes, parameters in many method signatures. Bunches of data that hang around together really ought to be made into their own object. The first step is to look for where they appear as fields. Use Extract Component (166) on the fields to turn them into an object. Then turn your attention to method signatures, using Introduce Parameter Object (247) or Preserve Whole Object (241) to slim them down. The immediate benefit here is that you can shrink a lot of parameter lists and make method calling a lot simpler.<br>数据项往往就像孩子一样——他们喜欢成群结队地在一起。通常，您会在很多地方看到相同的三到四个数据项：几个类中的字段、许多方法签名中的参数。一堆聚集在一起的数据确实应该被制作成它们自己的对象。第一步是查找它们作为字段出现的位置。对字段使用提取组件 (166) 将其转换为对象。然后将注意力转向方法签名，使用引入参数对象 (247) 或保留整个对象 (241) 来精简它们。这里直接的好处是你可以缩小很多参数列表并使方法调用变得更加简单。</p><p>Don’t worry about data clumps that only use some of the fields of the new object. As long as you are replacing a couple or more fields with the new object, you’ll come out ahead.<br>不必担心仅使用新对象的某些字段的数据块。只要您用新对象替换几个或多个字段，您就会取得领先。</p><p>A good test is to consider deleting one of the data values: if you did this would the others make any sense? If they don’t that’s a sure sign that you have an object that’s dying to be born.<br>一个好的测试是考虑删除一个数据值：如果您这样做，其他数据值是否有意义？如果他们不这样做，那就是一个明确的信号，表明你有一个即将诞生的物体。</p><p>Reducing field lists and parameter lists will certainly remove a few bad smells, but once you have the objects you get the opportunity to make a nice perfume. You can now look for cases of Divergent Change which will suggest behavior that can be moved into your new classes.<br>减少字段列表和参数列表肯定会消除一些难闻的气味，但是一旦你拥有了这些对象，你就有机会制作出美味的香水。您现在可以寻找发散性变化的案例，这些案例将建议可以转移到您的新类别中的行为。</p><p>Before long these classes will be productive members of society.<br>不久之后，这些阶级将成为社会的富有生产力的成员。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Case-Statements条件分支语句"><a href="#Case-Statements条件分支语句" class="headerlink" title="Case Statements条件分支语句"></a>Case Statements条件分支语句</h3><blockquote><p>One of the most obvious symptoms of object-oriented code is its lack of case (or switch) statements. The problem with case statements is essentially that of duplication. Often you find the same case statement scattered about a program for different purposes. If you add a type to the case you have to find all these case statements and change them. The object-oriented notion of polymorphism gives you an elegant way to deal with this problem.<br>面向对象代码最明显的症状之一是缺少 case（或 switch）语句。 case 语句的问题本质上是重复。通常，您会发现出于不同目的，相同的 case 语句分散在程序中。如果向 case 添加类型，则必须找到所有这些 case 语句并更改它们。面向对象的多态性概念为您提供了一种处理此问题的优雅方法。</p><p>So most times you see a case statement you should think about polymorphism, the issue is where should the polymorphism occur. Usually case statement will switch on a type code. You will want the method on class that hosts the type code value. So use Extract Method (114) to extract the switch statement and then Move Method (160) to get it onto the class where the polymorphism is needed. At that point you have to decide whether to Replace Type Code with Subclasses (224) or Replace Type Code with State&#x2F;Strategy (227). When you have set up the inheritance structure you can then Replace Switch with Polymorphism (147).<br>所以大多数时候你看到一个case语句你应该考虑多态性，问题是多态性应该发生在哪里。通常 case 语句会打开类型代码。您将需要托管类型代码值的类上的方法。因此，使用 Extract Method (114) 提取 switch 语句，然后使用 Move Method (160) 将其放到需要多态性的类中。此时，您必须决定是用子类替换类型代码 (224) 还是用状态&#x2F;策略替换类型代码 (227)。设置继承结构后，您可以用多态性替换 Switch (147)。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Parallel-Inheritance-Hierarchies并行继承层次结构"><a href="#Parallel-Inheritance-Hierarchies并行继承层次结构" class="headerlink" title="Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies并行继承层次结构"></a>Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies并行继承层次结构</h3><blockquote><p>This smell is really a special case of “the same rate off change in two objects”.

You can recognize this smell because the prefixes of the class names in one hierarchy are the same as the prefixes in another hierarchy.<br>这种气味实际上是“两个物体变化率相同”的特例。在这种情况下，每次创建一个类的子类时，您还必须创建另一个类的子类。您可以识别出这种气味，因为一个层次结构中的类名前缀与另一个层次结构中的前缀相同。</p><p>The general strategy for eliminating the duplication is to make sure that instances of one hierarchy refer to instances of the other, then use Move Method (160) and Move Field (164) the hierarchy disappears on the referring class.<br>消除重复的一般策略是确保一个层次结构的实例引用另一层次结构的实例，然后使用移动方法 (160) 和移动字段 (164)，层次结构在引用类上消失。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Lazy-Class懒惰类"><a href="#Lazy-Class懒惰类" class="headerlink" title="Lazy Class懒惰类"></a>Lazy Class懒惰类</h3><blockquote><p>Each class you create costs money.

Often you will get a vague feeling that the class doesn’t deserve subclasses, but you won’t immediately be able to see how to eliminate them. This feeling can last for months or even years. Don’t worry. If you keep nibbling away at the problems you can see how to solve, eventually you will find yourself looking at the subclasses again, and all the difficult issues to resolve will have disappeared.<br>有时你会看到一个类有四个子类，每个子类只实现三个简单的方法。通常你会隐约感觉到该类不值得有子类，但你不会立即知道如何消除它们。这种感觉可以持续数月甚至数年。不用担心。如果你不断地啃那些你能看到如何解决的问题，最终你会发现自己再次查看子类，所有需要解决的难题都将消失。</p><p>Once you’ve done this, look for new opportunities to use inheritance now that you are no longer wasting it.<br>完成此操作后，请寻找新的机会来使用继承，因为您不再浪费它了。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Temporary-Field临时字段"><a href="#Temporary-Field临时字段" class="headerlink" title="Temporary Field临时字段"></a>Temporary Field临时字段</h3><blockquote><p>Sometimes you will see an object where an instance variable is only set in certain circumstances.

All well and good,there is no need to know whether the director uses a diary, an electronic gizmo, or a secretary to keep track of her appointments.<br>对象的主要特征之一是封装：向外界隐藏内部细节。通常这种封装伴随着授权，你问一位主管她是否有空开会，她将信息委托给她的日记，然后给你一个答案。一切都很好，没有必要知道主任是否使用日记、电子小玩意或秘书来记录她的约会。</p><p>However this can go too far (particularly with those who take the Law of Demeter too seriously).

If you have to redundantly move code to accomplish this, you may be able to use Extract Superclass (282) to atone.<br>对执行相同操作但具有不同功能签名的任何方法使用重命名方法 (234)。通常这还不够。在这些情况下，班级做得还不够。继续使用移动方法 (160) 将行为移动到它们，直到协议相同。如果您必须冗余地移动代码来完成此操作，您可以使用 Extract Superclass (282) 来弥补。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Comments注释"><a href="#Comments注释" class="headerlink" title="Comments注释"></a>Comments注释</h3><blockquote><p>Don’t worry, we aren’t saying that people shouldn’t write comments.<br>别担心，我们并不是说人们不应该写注释。</p><p>In our olfactory analogy, comments aren’t a bad smell, indeed they are a sweet smell.<br>在我们的嗅觉比喻中，注释并不是难闻的气味，实际上它们是一种甜蜜的气味。</p><p>The reason we mention them here is because comments are often used as a deodorant.

I know we’re all working cross-functionally on this project, but so far the key stakeholders are really pleased with how it’s going. This project will really benefit our overall value proposition and the company as a whole.</p><p><strong>Akiko:</strong> Thanks, John. It’s an important project. It’s good to be collaborating on this together.</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yes, it’s important, but we’re all so busy with our regular jobs. It’ll be difficult to fit things in.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> It’s OK, Matteo. We’ll work it out. I know that you all have a lot on at the moment, combining this project with your regular jobs.</p><p><strong>Barbara:</strong> So, what do we need to do, and by when?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Good questions, Barbara. We have a number of key deliverables to discuss so it’s essential we’re all in agreement about roles and responsibilities and also the timelines we’re working to.</p><p><strong>Akiko:</strong> Great.</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yes, it’s good to get this clear.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> So, the first thing we need to do is design the customer survey questionnaire. In my experience, this is best done through an online survey tool.</p><p><strong>Akiko:</strong> That sounds like a great idea. I’m glad you have experience with this.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yeah, we’ve done something similar on previous projects.</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> So will you do that, John?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> I’d love to but I’m already tied up managing this project, and my line manager, Kate, has agreed that I should focus on the timelines, reporting and financial management. I’d like Akiko to lead on the questionnaire. You learned about this on your marketing and PR course, didn’t you?</p><p><strong>Akiko:</strong> Yeah, happy to take it on.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Thanks, Akiko. Next thing is we need the new designs finalised. Matteo, you said you could do this in a couple of weeks, right?</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yeah, I know, but that was last month, and then nothing happened. I’m overloaded at the moment and my line manager won’t be happy if I don’t hit my targets. Sorry, but this project has to take lower priority.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Hmm. I see. I can understand the challenge you’re facing. I’ve been in that situation before. So, what can we do to help you hit those targets and free up some time?</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> That’s a good question. If I could get a slight reduction in my targets, I could use the extra time that would create to finish the designs for this project.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> OK. We might not be able to get your targets reduced, but I’ll see what we can do.</p><p><strong>Barbara:</strong> How about if I support Matteo there? I know his job well and I have some capacity at the moment. I can help him meet his targets so he can free up some time to finish the designs for this project.</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Could you, Barbara?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Hmm. I’m not sure if it’s fair to ask Barbara to be supporting Matteo in his regular job so he can work on this project.</p><p><strong>Barbara:</strong> It’s up to you, but I’m happy to support Matteo with his regular work, just for a couple of weeks so he can create the designs. He’s the only one with the expertise.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yeah, you’re right. OK, thanks a lot, Barbara. I appreciate it. Matteo, would that work for you?</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yes, that would work. Thanks. OK, you’ve made it easy for me to say yes.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> OK, then that’s settled. Thanks, both. I really appreciate your help in this. So, can you get them done by the end of the month?</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yes, that should be no problem.</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p><strong>John:</strong> Thanks, everyone, for coming to this project meeting.

It’s an important project.

We have a number of key deliverables to discuss so it’s essential we’re all in agreement about roles and responsibilities and also the timelines we’re working to.<br>约翰：好问题，芭芭拉。我们有许多关键的可交付成果需要讨论，因此我们必须就角色和责任以及我们正在努力的时间表达成一致。</p><p><strong>Akiko:</strong> Great.<br>明子：太好了。</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yes, it’s good to get this clear.<br>Matteo：是的，很高兴弄清楚这一点。</p><p><strong>John:</strong> So, the first thing we need to do is design the customer survey questionnaire. In my experience, this is best done through an online survey tool.<br>约翰：所以，我们需要做的第一件事就是设计客户调查问卷。根据我的经验，这最好通过在线调查工具来完成。</p><p><strong>Akiko:</strong> That sounds like a great idea.

I’d like Akiko to lead on the questionnaire. You learned about this on your marketing and PR course, didn’t you?<br>约翰：我很愿意，但我已经忙于管理这个项目，而且我的直线经理凯特也同意我应该专注于时间表、报告和财务管理。我希望 Akiko 来主导调查问卷。您在营销和公关课程中学到了这一点，不是吗？</p><p><strong>Akiko:</strong> Yeah, happy to take it on.<br>Akiko：是的，很高兴接受它。</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Thanks, Akiko. Next thing is we need the new designs finalised. Matteo, you said you could do this in a couple of weeks, right?<br>约翰：谢谢，明子。接下来我们需要完成新的设计。 Matteo，你说过你可以在几周内做到这一点，对吧？</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yeah, I know, but that was last month, and then nothing happened. I’m overloaded at the moment and my line manager won’t be happy if I don’t hit my targets. Sorry, but this project has to take lower priority.<br>Matteo：是的，我知道，但那是上个月的事，然后什么也没发生。我现在超负荷了，如果我没有达到目标，我的直线经理会不高兴。抱歉，这个项目必须降低优先级。</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Hmm. I see. I can understand the challenge you’re facing. I’ve been in that situation before. So, what can we do to help you hit those targets and free up some time?<br>约翰：嗯。我懂了。我可以理解您面临的挑战。我以前也遇到过这种情况。那么，我们可以做些什么来帮助您实现这些目标并腾出一些时间呢？</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> That’s a good question. If I could get a slight reduction in my targets, I could use the extra time that would create to finish the designs for this project.<br>马特奥：这是个好问题。如果我可以稍微减少我的目标，我就可以利用额外的时间来完成这个项目的设计。</p><p><strong>John:</strong> OK. We might not be able to get your targets reduced, but I’ll see what we can do.<br>约翰：好的。我们可能无法降低您的目标，但我会看看我们能做些什么。</p><p><strong>Barbara:</strong> How about if I support Matteo there? I know his job well and I have some capacity at the moment. I can help him meet his targets so he can free up some time to finish the designs for this project.<br>芭芭拉：如果我支持马泰奥怎么样？我很了解他的工作，目前我也有一定的能力。我可以帮助他实现他的目标，这样他就可以腾出一些时间来完成这个项目的设计。</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Could you, Barbara?<br>马泰奥：芭芭拉，你可以吗？</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Hmm. I’m not sure if it’s fair to ask Barbara to be supporting Matteo in his regular job so he can work on this project.<br>约翰：嗯。我不确定要求 Barbara 支持 Matteo 的日常工作以便他能够从事这个项目是否公平。</p><p><strong>Barbara:</strong> It’s up to you, but I’m happy to support Matteo with his regular work, just for a couple of weeks so he can create the designs. He’s the only one with the expertise.<br>芭芭拉：这取决于你，但我很高兴支持 Matteo 的日常工作，只是几周时间，以便他可以进行设计。他是唯一一个拥有这方面专业知识的人。</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yeah, you’re right. OK, thanks a lot, Barbara. I appreciate it. Matteo, would that work for you?<br>约翰：是的，你说得对。 好的，非常感谢，芭芭拉。我很感激。马特奥，这对你有用吗？</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yes, that would work. Thanks. OK, you’ve made it easy for me to say yes.<br>Matteo：是的，那会有效。谢谢。好吧，你让我很容易就答应了。</p><p><strong>John:</strong> OK, then that’s settled. Thanks, both. I really appreciate your help in this. So, can you get them done by the end of the month?<br>约翰：好吧，那就这么定了。谢谢，两位。我真的很感谢你在这方面的帮助。 那么，你能在月底之前完成它们吗？</p><p><strong>Matteo:</strong> Yes, that should be no

And we’ve got writer Helen Slade and book critic Anna Kimura to talk us through them. First up, we’re looking at <em>Her Mother’s Daughter</em> by Alice Fitzgerald, a novel written from two points of view, one of a child and the other of her very troubled mother. Helen, I have to be honest. I found this one hard to read. It’s very well written but, well, how did you find it?</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: I know what you mean, but I literally couldn’t put it down and stayed up till three in the morning to finish it. There’s something about immersing yourself in a family this flawed, this damaged, that’s compelling. You’d never want to be in that family yourself, but that’s what reading is about, isn’t it? Wearing someone else’s shoes for a while without ever having to live their reality.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: You surprise me! The families in your own books are a million miles away from this one.</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: Yeah, my readers can always be sure they’re going to get a happy ending. Which you definitely … I don’t want to give too much away here, but you definitely don’t feel like a happy ending is coming for these characters.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: OK, so don’t mention the ending, but can you just describe for listeners what the book is about?</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: So, it’s about a family with secrets. The mother has hidden her troubled childhood from her husband and her two children but, of course, it’s shaped her entire personality and how she behaves as a mother and as a wife. Which is especially obvious when we’re reading the sections told in the child’s voice, even though the little girl herself doesn’t understand the meaning of everything she’s seeing.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: For me, what was really so shocking was less what happened to the mother when she was a child but how the mother treated her own children. Why is that, do you think?</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: I think we’re all programmed to see mothers as something sacred and pure. As a child she was mistreated by her father, and in some ways we’re not that shocked by that, which is a sad thing in itself, and her own mother didn’t help her. As a reader we’re less affected by that, I think, because that part of the story is revealed to us in the mother’s voice, the adult voice. But the reason the way she treats her own child is so much more shocking is that the child is telling us about it and we sympathise with her. It’s very clever how the author plays on our natural instincts to protect a child.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Though we do feel sorry for the mother too. Or, at least, I did.</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: It’s hard not to. She’s trapped in her own unhappiness.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: And we’re trapped right there with her as the reader. It made me wonder, Anna, why is it that miserable books like this one sell so well?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: Because all of us have families. I suppose the books play out things we all see in much smaller ways in our own family lives.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: The other hard-hitting book this week is <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em> by Lionel Shriver. Now there’s a family who have a problem!</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: They definitely do. Very few people will ever have a killer as a teenage son like the narrator in the book, but we can all identify with the challenges and often terrifying reality of raising teenagers!</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So can you give us the lowdown on <em>Kevin</em>, then, Anna?</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: This book is written from the point of view of the mother in letters she’s writing to her husband, Kevin’s father. Again, we shouldn’t say too much about the ending, but the way the author uses the letters is very clever.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I have to admit, I really enjoyed this book. It’s a difficult topic, but it was much easier to read than <em>Her Mother’s Daughter</em>.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: As Helen said before, it’s about the voice of the narrator. There’s no child’s voice and, in this story, the victims in many ways are the adults, though, of course, Kevin’s sister is a victim of her brother’s evil.</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: Yes, and the idea of where ‘evil’ comes from is a theme that comes out in both books. If you choose to call it ‘evil’ that is. I prefer to describe it as a complete lack of empathy. The mother in <em>Her Mother’s Daughter</em> had a terrible childhood, but Kevin’s from a happy home and good parents.</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Is he though? The mother often admits she found motherhood hard. Aren’t we supposed to think she might have caused Kevin to turn out the way he does? Just like in <em>Her Mother’s Daughter</em>.</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: Both books certainly look at how the mistakes of the parents affect children. And this is another reason we relate to these books. Parents are always worrying if they’re doing a good job.</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Today we’re looking at the <strong>darker</strong> side of <strong>literature</strong> with two books about not-so-happy families. And we’ve got writer Helen Slade and book critic Anna Kimura to talk us through them. First up, we’re looking at <em>Her Mother’s Daughter</em> by Alice Fitzgerald, a novel written from two points of view, one of a child and the other of her very troubled mother. Helen, I have to be honest. I found this one hard to read. It’s very well written but, well, how did you find it?<br>主持人：今天我们将通过两本关于不那么幸福的家庭的书来探讨文学的阴暗面。 我们邀请了作家海伦·斯莱德和书评家安娜·木村来为我们讲述这些故事。首先，我们看的是爱丽丝·菲茨杰拉德的《她母亲的女儿》，这是一本从两个角度写的小说，一个是一个孩子，另一个是她陷入困境的母亲。海伦，我必须说实话。我发现这一篇很难读。写得很好，但是，你是怎么找到它的？</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: I know what you mean, but I <strong>literally</strong> couldn’t put it down and stayed up till three in the morning to finish it. There’s something about <strong>immersing</strong> yourself in a family this flawed, this damaged, that’s compelling. You’d never want to be in that family yourself, but that’s what reading is about, isn’t it? Wearing someone else’s shoes for a while without ever having to live their reality.<br>海伦：我知道你的意思，但我确实无法放下它，直到凌晨三点才完成它。让自己沉浸在一个如此有缺陷、如此受损的家庭中，这是令人着迷的。你永远不想自己成为那个家庭的一员，但这就是阅读的意义，不是吗？暂时穿着别人的鞋子，却不必生活在现实中。</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: You surprise me! The families in your own books are a million miles away from this one.<br>主持人：你让我很惊讶！你自己书中的家庭与这个家庭相距一百万英里。</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: Yeah, my readers can always be sure they’re going to get a happy ending. Which you definitely … I don’t want to give too much away here, but you definitely don’t feel like a happy ending is coming for these characters.<br>海伦：是的，我的读者总是可以确信他们会得到一个幸福的结局。你肯定……我不想在这里透露太多，但你绝对不觉得这些角色会有一个幸福的结局。</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: OK, so don’t mention the ending, but can you just describe for listeners what the book is about?<br>主持人：好的，所以先不提结局，但您能为听众描述一下这本书的内容吗？</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: So, it’s about a family with secrets. The mother has hidden her troubled childhood from her husband and her two children but, of course, it’s shaped her entire personality and how she behaves as a mother and as a wife. Which is especially obvious when we’re reading the sections told in the child’s voice, even though the little girl herself doesn’t understand the meaning of everything she’s seeing.<br>海伦：所以，这是关于一个有秘密的家庭的故事。这位母亲向她的丈夫和两个孩子隐瞒了她坎坷的童年，但这当然塑造了她的整个性格以及她作为母亲和妻子的行为方式。当我们阅读孩子的声音讲述的部分时，这一点尤其明显，尽管小女孩自己并不理解她所看到的一切的含义。</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: For me, what was really so shocking was less what happened to the mother when she was a child but how the mother treated her own children. Why is that, do you think?<br>主持人：对我来说，真正令人震惊的不是这位母亲小时候发生的事情，而是这位母亲如何对待自己的孩子。你认为这是为什么呢？</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: I think we’re all programmed to see mothers as something sacred and pure. As a child she was <strong>mistreated</strong> by her father, and in some ways we’re not that shocked by that, which is a sad thing in itself, and her own mother didn’t help her. As a reader we’re less affected by that, I think, because that part of the story is revealed to us in the mother’s voice, the adult voice. But the reason the way she treats her own child is so much more shocking is that the child is telling us about it and we <strong>sympathise</strong> with her. It’s very clever how the author plays on our natural instincts to protect a child.<br>海伦：我认为我们生来就将母亲视为神圣而纯洁的事物。小时候，她受到父亲的虐待，从某些方面来说，我们对此并不感到震惊，这本身就是一件悲伤的事情，而且她自己的母亲也没有帮助她。我认为，作为读者，我们受此影响较小，因为故事的这一部分是通过母亲的声音，成人的声音向我们揭示的。但她对待自己孩子的方式之所以如此令人震惊，是因为孩子告诉我们这件事，我们同情她。作者非常聪明地利用了我们保护孩子的本能。</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Though we do feel sorry for the mother too. Or, at least, I did.<br>主持人：虽然我们也为母亲感到难过。或者，至少，我做到了。</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: It’s hard not to. She’s trapped in her own unhappiness.<br>海伦：很难不这样做。她陷入了自己的不幸之中。</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: And we’re trapped right there with her as the reader. It made me wonder, Anna, why is it that miserable books like this one sell so well?<br>主持人：我们被困在那里，她是读者。这让我想知道，安娜，为什么像这样一本悲惨的书卖得这么好？</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: Because all of us have families. I suppose the books play out things we all see in much smaller ways in our own family lives.<br>安娜：因为我们都有家庭。我想这些书以更小的方式展现了我们在自己的家庭生活中看到的事情。</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: The other hard-hitting book this week is <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em> by Lionel Shriver. Now there’s a family who have a problem!<br>主持人：本周另一本热门书籍是莱昂内尔·施赖弗 (Lionel Shriver) 所著的《我们需要谈谈凯文》。现在有一个家庭遇到了问题！</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: They definitely do. Very few people will ever have a killer as a teenage son like the narrator in the book, but we can all identify with the challenges and often terrifying reality of raising teenagers!<br>安娜：他们确实这么做了。很少有人会像书中的叙述者一样，在青少年时期拥有杀手，但我们都可以体会到抚养青少年所面临的挑战和常常令人恐惧的现实！</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: So can you give us the lowdown on <em>Kevin</em>, then, Anna?<br>主持人：安娜，您能给我们介绍一下凯文的内幕吗？</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: This book is written from the point of view of the mother in letters she’s writing to her husband, Kevin’s father. Again, we shouldn’t say too much about the ending, but the way the author uses the letters is very clever.<br>安娜：这本书是从母亲的角度写的，写给她的丈夫，也就是凯文的父亲。再说一次，我们不应该对结局说太多，但作者使用字母的方式非常聪明。</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I have to admit, I really enjoyed this book. It’s a difficult topic, but it was much easier to read than <em>Her Mother’s Daughter</em>.<br>主持人：我必须承认，我真的很喜欢这本书。这是一个很难的话题，但比《她母亲的女儿》容易读得多。</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: As Helen said before, it’s about the voice of the <strong>narrator</strong>. There’s no child’s voice and, in this story, the victims in many ways are the adults, though, of course, Kevin’s sister is a victim of her brother’s evil.<br>安娜：正如海伦之前所说，这是关于叙述者的声音。没有孩子的声音，在这个故事中，受害者在很多方面都是成年人，当然，凯文的妹妹是她哥哥邪恶的受害者。</p><p><strong>Helen</strong>: Yes, and the idea of where ‘evil’ comes from is a theme that comes out in both books. If you choose to call it ‘evil’ that is. I prefer to describe it as a complete lack of <strong>empathy</strong>. The mother in <em>Her Mother’s Daughter</em> had a terrible childhood, but Kevin’s from a happy home and good parents.<br>海伦：是的，“邪恶”从何而来的想法是两本书中都出现的主题。如果你选择称其为“邪恶”，那就是。我更喜欢将其描述为完全缺乏同理心。 《她母亲的女儿》中的母亲有一个糟糕的童年，但凯文却来自一个幸福的家庭和良好的父母。</p><p><strong>Presenter</strong>: Is he though? The mother often admits she found motherhood hard. Aren’t we supposed to think she might have caused Kevin to turn out the way he does? Just like in <em>Her Mother’s Daughter</em>.<br>主持人：他是吗？这位母亲经常承认，她发现做母亲很艰难。难道我们不应该认为她可能导致凯文变成现在这个样子吗？就像她母亲的女儿一样。</p><p><strong>Anna</strong>: Both books certainly look at how the mistakes of the parents affect children. And this is another reason we relate to these books. Parents are always worrying if they’re doing a good job.<br>安娜：这两本书当然都探讨了父母的错误如何影响孩子。这是我们与这些书相关的另一个原因。父母总是担心他们是否做得好。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="An-interview-about-two-books-–-1"><a href="#An-interview-about-two-books-–-1" class="headerlink" title="An interview about two books – 1"></a>An interview about two books – 1</h4><p>Put the phrases in the correct group.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><p>Her Mother’s Daughter<br>We Need to Talk About Kevin</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Was challenging for the podcast presenter to finish<br>About an adolescent child<br>Includes murder in the story<br>Partly told from a child’s perspective<br>Involves three generations of one family<br>Features a normal family</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Her Mother’s Daughter<br>她母亲的女儿<br>We Need to Talk About Kevin<br>我们需要谈谈凯文</p><p>Was challenging for the podcast presenter to finish<br>对播客主持人来说完成这本书是个挑战<br>About an adolescent child<br>关于一个青少年<br>Includes murder in the story<br>故事中包括谋杀<br>Partly told from a child’s perspective<br>部分从孩子的视角讲述<br>Involves three generations of one family<br>涉及一个家庭的三代人<br>Features a normal family<br>以一个普通家庭为主角</p></blockquote><ul><li>Answer</li></ul><img src="/2024/03/22/c1-listening-03-interview-about-two-books/image-20240807220228773.png" class="" title="image-20240807220228773"><blockquote><p><strong>Her Mother’s Daughter</strong><br>Partly told from a child’s perspective部分从孩子的视角讲述<br>Was challenging for the podcast presenter to finish对播客主持人来说完成这本书是个挑战<br>Involves three generations of one family涉及一个家庭的三代人</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>We Need to Talk About Kevin</strong><br>About an adolescent child关于一个青少年<br>Includes murder in the story故事中包括谋杀<br>Features a normal family以一个普通家庭为主角</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task2"><a href="#Task2" class="headerlink" title="Task2"></a>Task2</h3><h4 id="A-project-management-meeting-–-2"><a href="#A-project-management-meeting-–-2" class="headerlink" title="A project management meeting – 2"></a>A project management meeting – 2</h4><p>Put the sentences in the correct order.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>The presenter and Helen differ on …<br>a. how they see the characters in the book.<br>b. what they think about the quality of the writing.<br>c. how much they enjoyed reading the book.</li><li>Helen enjoyed Her Mother’s Daughter because …<br>a. it’s totally different from the books she writes herself.<br>b. it’s totally different from her own life.<br>c. it has a happy ending.</li><li>What is Her Mother’s Daughter about?<br>a.

Thanks for coming in for the interview.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: It’s my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Well, as you know, the company has been expanding and we have an opening in our HR department. We’re creating a new role for someone to lead our training and development within the company.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, I very much think that my skills and experience are a good fit for what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That sounds great. So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you’ve been doing over the past four years or so.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider which offered HR services, including L&amp;D, to corporate clients.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: OK, so it was only B2B?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, that’s right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, I very much like the L&amp;D side of my role and I’ve always had particularly good feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I’m looking to specialise, and as your company has around 2,000 people, right …? </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yes, that’s right.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&amp;D. I’m also a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&amp;D qualification.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we’re looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won’t be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role.  </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Yes, that would be a good thing.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Also, I’m used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me?</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Um, I think we’ve covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick questions though.</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Go on.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Well, there’s the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team, which currently has six people in it. There’s usually an intern or two who you can get some support from also.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: OK. Thanks. That’s all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this role will be measured. What does success look like?</p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That’s a good question. As you know, we have a performance management system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs within the organisation. But we haven’t devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and then successfully implement this strategy.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Thank you. That sounds interesting.  </p><p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We’ll be discussing all candidates next week and then I’ll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong>: Thank you for your time. I’d welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.</p></blockquote><h4 id="English-Chinese"><a href="#English-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="English-Chinese"></a>English-Chinese</h4><blockquote><p>Interviewer: Hello, Maria. Thanks for coming in for the interview.<br>面试官：你好，玛丽亚。感谢您接受面试。</p><p>Maria: It’s my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.<br>玛丽亚：这是我的荣幸。谢谢你邀请我。</p><p>Interviewer: Well, as you know, the company has been expanding and we have an opening in our HR department. We’re creating a new role for someone to lead our training and development within the company.<br>面试官：嗯，如您所知，公司一直在扩张，我们的人力资源部门有一个空缺。我们正在为某人设立一个新角色来领导公司内部的培训和发展。</p><p>Maria: Yes, I very much think that my skills and experience are a good fit for what you’re looking for.<br>玛丽亚：是的，我非常认为我的技能和经验非常适合您正在寻找的东西。</p><p>Interviewer: That sounds great. So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you’ve been doing over the past four years or so.<br>面试官：听起来很棒。所以，你的简历看起来很不错，不过如果你能用你自己的话向我们概述一下你在过去四年左右的时间里所做的事情，那就更好了。</p><p>Maria: Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider which offered HR services, including L&amp;D, to corporate clients.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，四年前，在我的第一份工作中，我为一家小型人力资源服务提供商工作，该提供商为企业客户提供包括学习与发展在内的人力资源服务。</p><p>Interviewer: OK, so it was only B2B?<br>面试官：好的，所以这只是 B2B？</p><p>Maria: Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C.<br>Maria：是的，我们只向其他公司提供服务，而不是 B2C。</p><p>Interviewer: Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago.<br>面试官：是的，上面写着你大约三年前离开了那家公司。</p><p>Maria: Yes, that’s right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development.<br>玛丽亚：是的，没错。我寻求更多的稳定性，并成为更大组织的一部分。因此，我加入了一家拥有大约一百名员工和一个小型人力资源团队的公司。由于我们只有几个人，所以我们每个人都处理一系列人力资源主题。除了工资之外，我负责的领域之一是学习和发展。</p><p>Interviewer: I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now?<br>面试官：我明白了。那么，你为什么现在想换工作呢？</p><p>Maria: Well, I very much like the L&amp;D side of my role and I’ve always had particularly good feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I’m looking to specialise, and as your company has around 2,000 people, right …?<br>玛丽亚：嗯，我非常喜欢我的角色中的学习与发展方面，并且我在该领域的工作一直得到特别好的反馈。我相信我在该领域表现出色。所以，我希望专业化，而贵公司大约有 2,000 名员工，对吧……？</p><p>Interviewer: Yes, that’s right.<br>面试官：是的，没错。</p><p>Maria: Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&amp;D. I’m also a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，这种规模的组织将为我提供专门从事学习与发展的空间。我也是您品牌的忠实追随者，并且感觉与您的形象和价值观完全一致。</p><p>Interviewer: Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&amp;D qualification.<br>面试官：嗯，听起来不错。我可以看到你有 L&amp;D 证书。</p><p>Maria: Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management.<br>玛丽亚：是的，我两年前获得了文凭。我目前还在攻读心理学进一步文凭，特别关注学习和绩效管理。</p><p>Interviewer: Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we’re looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company?<br>面试官：非常好。嗯，看来您具备我们正在寻找的资质和经验。您认为加入一家更大的公司将面临哪些主要挑战？</p><p>Maria: I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won’t be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role.<br>玛丽亚：我可以看到，在如此规模的组织中没有经验可能会被视为一种弱点，而我认为这也可能是一种优势。我不会给这个角色带来太多先入为主、可能不灵活的想法。</p><p>Interviewer: Yes, that would be a good thing.<br>面试官：是的，那将是一件好事。</p><p>Maria: Also, I’m used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale.<br>玛丽亚：此外，我习惯于采取非常个人化的方法来进行员工发展。我意识到，这种拥有 2,000 名员工的方法必须以不同的方式进行，但我带来了许多可以在更大范围内复制的想法。</p><p>Interviewer: I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me?<br>面试官：我明白你的意思。好的，那么，您有什么问题要问我吗？</p><p>Maria: Um, I think we’ve covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick questions though.<br>玛丽亚：嗯，我认为我们已经涵盖了我想要解决的许多领域。不过我有两个简单的问题。</p><p>Interviewer: Go on.<br>面试官：继续。</p><p>Maria: Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?<br>玛丽亚：我每天主要和谁一起工作？</p><p>Interviewer: Well, there’s the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team, which currently has six people in it. There’s usually an intern or two who you can get some support from also.<br>面试官：嗯，您要向人力资源经理汇报。然后是人力资源团队，目前有六人。通常还有一两个实习生，你也可以从他们那里得到一些支持。</p><p>Maria: OK. Thanks. That’s all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this role will be measured. What does success look like?<br>玛丽亚：好的。谢谢。这一切都很清楚。我的另一个问题是如何衡量这个角色的表现。成功是什么样的？</p><p>Interviewer: That’s a good question. As you know, we have a performance management system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs within the organisation. But we haven’t devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and then successfully implement this strategy.<br>面试官：这是个好问题。如您所知，我们有一个绩效管理系统，从中我们确定了组织内的一些学习和发展需求。但我们还没有制定策略。您的角色是制定并成功实施该策略。</p><p>Maria: Thank you. That sounds interesting.<br>玛丽亚：谢谢。听起来很有趣。</p><p>Interviewer: Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We’ll be discussing all candidates next week and then I’ll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome.<br>面试官：太好了。再次感谢您今天的光临。我们将在下周讨论所有候选人，然后我会在下周末之前回复您，让您知道结果。</p><p>Maria: Thank you for your time. I’d welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.<br>玛丽亚：谢谢您的宝贵时间。我很高兴有机会与您继续讨论这个角色。</p></blockquote><h3 id="Task1"><a href="#Task1" class="headerlink" title="Task1"></a>Task1</h3><h4 id="A-job-interview-–-1"><a href="#A-job-interview-–-1" class="headerlink" title="A job interview – 1"></a>A job interview – 1</h4><p>Choose the correct answers.</p><ul><li>Question</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>Four years ago, Maria worked for a small HR services provider …<br>a. in the B2B sector.<br>b. in the B2C sector.<br>c. in both B2B and B2C sectors.</li><li>Maria has been in her current job …<br>a. for four years.<br>b. for three years.<br>c. for one year.</li><li>Maria’s current role is focused …<br>a. only on learning and development.<br>b. on a number of HR topics.<br>c. only on payroll and she wants to do L&amp;D.</li><li>Maria …<br>a. did a diploma in L&amp;D two years ago.<br>b. is doing a diploma in psychology at the moment.<br>c.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And hello, I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>Now Rob, how creative are you?</p><p>Rob<br>Very creative, I think. Creativity is in my bones! Look at this wonderful script that I wrote and we’re presenting right now.</p><p>Neil<br>You are what we could call ‘a creative’ – a noun which means someone with a lot of imagination and ideas. In our job we have to create – or make – content that teaches English creatively.</p><p>Rob<br>Creativity is becoming more important for everyone. The World Economic Forum forecasts that by 2020, creativity will be in the top three most important skills for future jobs. This is particularly relevant for younger people who will be entering the world of work soon – and that’s what we’ll be discussing today. But before we do, Neil, have you created a question for us to answer?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, and it’s about the very creative artist Banksy. He created a well-known piece of artwork that has been in the news recently, but do you know what it is called? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon Girl.</p><p>Rob<br>I can see the picture in my head – so I think it’s c) Balloon Girl.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about creativity. Experts say that students need to focus more on creativity to help them get a job. That’s perhaps surprising in the UK, when some of our creative industries – that’s businesses that make music, art and TV for example – are world famous. We are creative people, Rob!</p><p>Rob<br>Of course, but there’s not such a focus on being creative in education now and that might have an effect in the future. It’s something Bernadette Duffy, an early years consultant, has been discussing on BBC Radio 4’s Bringing up Britain programme. What does she say we have been focusing too much on in schools?</p><p>Bernadette Duffy, early years consultant<br>We focus on the things that are legitimately important but we teach them in a way that makes them easier to measure. I think we need to redress the balance that puts the focus purely on gaining the skills and far far more on actually using them in a creative way because that’s what’s going to make a difference for the future.</p><p>Neil<br>So Bernadette feels we teach skills in a way that can be easily measured and tested. She says we teach these skills legitimately – which here means fairly and reasonably. But she feels we don’t teach a creative approach to learning skills.</p><p>Rob<br>So we mean things like problem solving. I guess, even tasks like data inputting and preparing spreadsheets can be approached creatively. In any job, it’s sometimes good to ‘think outside the box’ or find new ways of doing things.</p><p>Neil<br>Bernadette thinks we should move away from just learning skills and start using these skills creatively – she used the expression ‘redress the balance’ which means ‘change things to make them fairer and more equal’.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, here at the BBC we have to creative. In fact one of our values states that ‘creativity is the lifeblood of our organisation’. Lifeblood here means ‘the most important thing to make something a success’.</p><p>Neil<br>Rob, I can see creativity is in your blood – but on an everyday level how can we all improve our creativity – be like you?!</p><p>Rob<br>Well, Neil, I’m no expert but Innovation Manager, Nick Skillicorn is. He’s also been speaking to the BBC and explaining what we can do to help ourselves. What does he suggest?</p><p>Nick Skillicorn, Innovation Manager<br>On a daily basis, everyone should take fifteen minutes of what I call unfocused time – time that they’re not looking at any screen, time that they can essentially get back into their own head, slow down a bit, and start forming these new connections between disparate ideas that result in divergent new original ideas.</p><p>Neil<br>So we need free time to collect all our different thoughts in our head – what Nick calls disparate ideas to create new and amazing ideas.</p><p>Rob<br>Disparate ideas are very different ideas, all unrelated. And we need what we might call headspace – that’s when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. For me, I have headspace when I’m lying in the bath or out riding my bike – there are no interruptions.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, you certainly don’t get your ideas sitting at a desk, focusing on one task – we all need some downtime to get creative. But children going into school now will grow up to do a job that doesn’t yet exist. And faced with the challenges of AI, automation, green issues and an ageing population, creativity and imagination will be vital.</p><p>Rob<br>Right, well, let’s get back to talking about the creativity of Banksy now.</p><p>Neil<br>Ah yes, because earlier I asked you which one of his well-known pieces of artwork has been in the news recently? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon girl.</p><p>Rob<br>And I said c) Balloon Girl. I know it was a girl and a balloon.</p><p>Neil<br>Not quite right, Rob. The artwork is titled ‘Girl with Balloon.’ This was recently auctioned in London but amazingly shredded in its frame as someone’s winning bid was accepted!</p><p>Rob<br>Wow, that’s a very creative way to destroy a picture! I will do the same with this script soon but not before we have recapped some of today’s vocabulary. Starting with ‘a creative’ - a person whose job is to use a lot of imagination and come up with new ideas, such as someone who works in the media or advertising.</p><p>Neil<br>Then we mentioned legitimately – which describes doing something fairly and reasonably.</p><p>Rob<br>Next we heard the expression ‘redress the balance’. This means to make things fairer and more equal.</p><p>Neil<br>We also talked about creativity being the lifeblood of the BBC. Lifeblood here means the most important thing to make something a success. And I know creativity is running through your veins, Rob!</p><p>Rob<br>Thanks, Neil. We also heard the word disparate, meaning very different and unrelated.

Goodbye.</p><p>Rob<br>Bye bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.<br>你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And hello, I’m Rob.<br>大家好，我是 罗伯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now Rob, how creative are you?<br>现在 罗伯，你的创意如何？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Very creative, I think. Creativity is in my bones! Look at this wonderful script that I wrote and we’re presenting right now.<br>我认为非常有创意。创造力就在我的骨子里！看看我写的这个精彩的剧本，我们现在正在展示。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You are what we could call ‘a creative’ – a noun which means someone with a lot of imagination and ideas. In our job we have to create – or make – content that teaches English creatively.<br>您就是我们可以称之为“创意者”的人 —— 一个名词，意思是具有丰富想象力和想法的人。在我们的工作中，我们必须创建或制作具有创造性英语教学的内容。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Creativity is becoming more important for everyone. The World Economic Forum forecasts that by 2020, creativity will be in the top three most important skills for future jobs. This is particularly relevant for younger people who will be entering the world of work soon – and that’s what we’ll be discussing today. But before we do, Neil, have you created a question for us to answer?<br>创造力对每个人来说都变得越来越重要。世界经济论坛预测，到 2020 年，创造力将成为未来工作最重要的三大技能之一。这对于即将进入职场的年轻人尤其重要，这就是我们今天要讨论的内容。但在我们这样做之前，Neil，您是否提出了一个问题让我们回答？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, and it’s about the very creative artist Banksy. He created a well-known piece of artwork that has been in the news recently, but do you know what it is called? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon Girl.<br>是的，这是关于非常有创造力的艺术家 Banksy 的。他创作了一件最近上了新闻的著名艺术品，但你知道它叫什么吗？是吗。。。a） 带气球的女孩；b） 带红气球的女孩 c） 气球女孩。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I can see the picture in my head – so I think it’s c) Balloon Girl.<br>我可以在脑海中看到这幅画 —— 所以我认为它是 c） Balloon Girl。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about creativity. Experts say that students need to focus more on creativity to help them get a job. That’s perhaps surprising in the UK, when some of our creative industries – that’s businesses that make music, art and TV for example – are world famous. We are creative people, Rob!<br>好的，我们稍后会找出答案。但现在回到我们关于创造力的讨论。专家表示，学生需要更多地关注创造力，以帮助他们找到工作。这在英国可能很令人惊讶，因为我们的一些创意产业 —— 例如制作音乐、艺术和电视的企业 —— 举世闻名。我们是有创造力的人，罗伯！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Of course, but there’s not such a focus on being creative in education now and that might have an effect in the future. It’s something Bernadette Duffy, an early years consultant, has been discussing on BBC Radio 4’s Bringing up Britain programme. What does she say we have been focusing too much on in schools?<br>当然，但现在没有那么注重教育的创造力，这可能会在未来产生影响。这是早期教育顾问伯纳黛特·达菲 在 BBC Radio 4 的“培养英国”节目中一直在讨论的问题。她说我们在学校里太关注什么了？</p><p>Bernadette Duffy, early years consultant(Bernadette Duffy，早期教育顾问)<br>We focus on the things that are legitimately important but we teach them in a way that makes them easier to measure. I think we need to redress the balance that puts the focus purely on gaining the skills and far far more on actually using them in a creative way because that’s what’s going to make a difference for the future.<br>我们专注于合法重要的事情，但我们以一种更容易衡量的方式教授它们。我认为我们需要纠正这种平衡，这种平衡将重点纯粹放在获得技能上，而更多地放在以创造性的方式实际使用它们上，因为这将对未来产生影响。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So Bernadette feels we teach skills in a way that can be easily measured and tested. She says we teach these skills legitimately – which here means fairly and reasonably. But she feels we don’t teach a creative approach to learning skills.<br>因此，Bernadette 认为我们以一种易于衡量和测试的方式教授技能。她说，我们合法地教授这些技能 —— 这里的意思是公平合理的。但她认为我们没有教授一种创造性的方法来学习技能。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>So we mean things like problem solving. I guess, even tasks like data inputting and preparing spreadsheets can be approached creatively. In any job, it’s sometimes good to ‘think outside the box’ or find new ways of doing things.<br>所以我们指的是解决问题之类的事情。我想，即使是数据输入和准备电子表格等任务也可以创造性地完成。在任何工作中，有时“跳出框框思考”或寻找新的做事方式都是好的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Bernadette thinks we should move away from just learning skills and start using these skills creatively – she used the expression ‘redress the balance’ which means ‘change things to make them fairer and more equal’.<br>Bernadette 认为我们应该从仅仅学习技能开始创造性地使用这些技能 —— 她使用了“redress the balance”这个词，意思是“改变事物，让它们更公平、更平等”。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, here at the BBC we have to creative. In fact one of our values states that ‘creativity is the lifeblood of our organisation’. Lifeblood here means ‘the most important thing to make something a success’.<br>好吧，在 BBC，我们必须发挥创造力。事实上，我们的价值观之一就是“创造力是我们组织的命脉”。Lifeblood 在这里的意思是“使某事成功最重要的事情”。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Rob, I can see creativity is in your blood – but on an everyday level how can we all improve our creativity – be like you?!<br>罗伯，我能看出创造力流淌在你的血液中 —— 但在日常层面上，我们如何才能提高我们的创造力 —— 像你一样？！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, Neil, I’m no expert but Innovation Manager, Nick Skillicorn is. He’s also been speaking to the BBC and explaining what we can do to help ourselves. What does he suggest?<br>好吧，Neil，我不是专家，但创新经理 Nick Skillicorn 是。他还一直在接受 BBC 的采访，解释我们可以做些什么来帮助自己。他建议什么呢？</p><p>Nick Skillicorn, Innovation Manager(Nick Skillicorn，创新经理)<br>On a daily basis, everyone should take fifteen minutes of what I call unfocused time – time that they’re not looking at any screen, time that they can essentially get back into their own head, slow down a bit, and start forming these new connections between disparate ideas that result in divergent new original ideas.<br>每天，每个人都应该花 15 分钟我所说的无重点时间 —— 他们不看任何屏幕的时间，他们基本上可以回到自己的脑海中，放慢一点速度，开始在不同的想法之间形成这些新的联系，从而导致不同的新原创想法。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So we need free time to collect all our different thoughts in our head – what Nick calls disparate ideas to create new and amazing ideas.<br>因此，我们需要空闲时间在脑海中收集所有不同的想法 —— Nick 称之为不同的想法，以创造新的和令人惊叹的想法。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Disparate ideas are very different ideas, all unrelated. And we need what we might call headspace – that’s when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. For me, I have headspace when I’m lying in the bath or out riding my bike – there are no interruptions.<br>不同的想法是截然不同的想法，都是不相关的。我们需要我们所谓的头脑空间 – 那时你的大脑处于良好的状态，你可以清晰地思考。对我来说，当我躺在浴缸里或骑自行车时，我有头部空间 —— 不会被打扰。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, you certainly don’t get your ideas sitting at a desk, focusing on one task – we all need some downtime to get creative. But children going into school now will grow up to do a job that doesn’t yet exist. And faced with the challenges of AI, automation, green issues and an ageing population, creativity and imagination will be vital.<br>好吧，你肯定不会把你的想法放在办公桌前，专注于一项任务 —— 我们都需要一些休息时间来发挥创意。但是现在上学的孩子长大后会从事一份尚不存在的工作。面对人工智能、自动化、绿色问题和人口老龄化的挑战，创造力和想象力将至关重要。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Right, well, let’s get back to talking about the creativity of Banksy now.<br>好了，好吧，现在让我们回到 Banksy 的创造力上来。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Ah yes, because earlier I asked you which one of his well-known pieces of artwork has been in the news recently? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon girl.<br>啊，是的，因为之前我问你最近他的哪一件知名作品上了新闻？是吗。。。a） 带气球的女孩；b） 带红气球的女孩 c） 气球女孩。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I said c) Balloon Girl. I know it was a girl and a balloon.<br>我说 c） 气球女孩。我知道那是一个女孩和一个气球。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Not quite right, Rob. The artwork is titled ‘Girl with Balloon.’ This was recently auctioned in London but amazingly shredded in its frame as someone’s winning bid was accepted!<br>不太对劲，罗伯。这件作品的标题是“带气球的女孩”。这辆车最近在伦敦拍卖，但令人惊讶的是，由于有人的中标被接受，它被撕碎了！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Wow, that’s a very creative way to destroy a picture! I will do the same with this script soon but not before we have recapped some of today’s vocabulary. Starting with ‘a creative’ - a person whose job is to use a lot of imagination and come up with new ideas, such as someone who works in the media or advertising.<br>哇，这是一种非常有创意的销毁图片的方法！我很快就会对这个脚本做同样的事情，但在此之前，我们会回顾一下今天的一些词汇。从“创意人员”开始 - 其工作是发挥大量想象力并提出新想法的人，例如在媒体或广告行业工作的人。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Then we mentioned legitimately – which describes doing something fairly and reasonably.<br>然后我们提到了 legimately – 它描述了公平合理地做某事。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Next we heard the expression ‘redress the balance’. This means to make things fairer and more equal.<br>接下来，我们听到了“redress the balance”这个说法。这意味着让事情变得更公平、更平等。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We also talked about creativity being the lifeblood of the BBC. Lifeblood here means the most important thing to make something a success. And I know creativity is running through your veins, Rob!<br>我们还谈到了创造力是 BBC 的命脉。Lifeblood 在这里意味着使某事成功最重要的事情。我知道创造力在你的血管中流淌，罗伯！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Thanks, Neil. We also heard the word disparate, meaning very different and unrelated. And we talked about headspace, which is when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly.<br>谢谢，Neil。我们还听到了 disparate 这个词，意思是非常不同且不相关。我们谈到了顶空，即当你的大脑处于良好状态并且可以清晰思考时。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Before we head off to find some headspace, don’t forget to visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com for more great learning English content.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Catherine.</p><p>Rob<br>And hello, I’m Rob.</p><p>Catherine<br>Now Rob, do you ever buy things at a charity shop?</p><p>Rob<br>Yes I do. They are a great place to pick up a bargain and I also donate items to charity shops too. And a charity shop, by the way, is a shop where people take their unwanted items and then the shop sells them and makes money and the money goes to the charity.</p><p>Catherine<br>Exactly that’s good to hear Rob, because donating – that’s giving money or goods to an organisation – helps charities raise money. And you might be interested to know that dressing up in second-hand clothes is back in fashion – well sort of - and that’s what we’re discussing today – is looking like you’re dressing in charity shops clothes a new fashion statement?</p><p>Rob<br>It should be interesting but first Catherine, aren’t you going to set me a question to answer – and not a second-hand one please!</p><p>Catherine<br>It’s a brand new question today Rob, for you and the listeners at home – do you know when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK? Was it in… a) 1928; b) 1948, or c) 1968?</p><p>Rob<br>I’ll go for 1948.</p><p>Catherine<br>OK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about charity shops and fashion. And there’s a new look in town, which some people are calling ‘scumbro’. Scumbro combines the word ‘scummy’ which means ‘dirty and messy’ with the word ‘bro’, which is an informal way of referring to a boy or man. So scumbro is a fashion for men – but women can adopt it too.</p><p>Rob<br>It’s a bit of an insulting name and here’s the odd thing about this new fashion style: Being scumbro is about buying expensive designer-brands that look like they are from a charity shop. Very odd!</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, it’s something Amber Graafland knows about. She is the Fashion &amp; Beauty Director for the Daily Mirror newspaper and she’s been telling BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme all about it. So, how did this trend start?</p><p>Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily Mirror<br>Well I think the name came from a Vanity Fair article, and I think Justin Bieber, the likes of Jonah Hill to thank for this look, Pete Davidson, who’s actually the fiancée of Ariana Grande – he’s definitely one of the founding fathers of scumbro. And I think, like most of these trends, they’re started by celebrities and then, I mean look, it’s been picked up by everybody by the sounds of things.</p><p>Rob<br>OK, so the fashion magazine Vanity Fair invented the name but the trend has spread because celebrities have been dressing in this style.</p><p>Catherine<br>Yes and Amber mentioned a number of celebrities who are the founding fathers of the trend – that’s a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, the trend has been picked up – or copied - by people who you might describe as fashion victims – people who have to follow the latest fashion trends.</p><p>Catherine<br>Well Rob, I’m no fashion victim – but I say, maybe, one day, I might want to look scumbro – or maybe scumsis! So how exactly should I dress?</p><p>Rob<br>OK, well let’s hear from Amber Graafland again. How does she describe the characteristics of this fashion trend?</p><p>Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily Mirror<br>It’s all about wearing these oversized clothes that are overpriced and I think it’s not just about looking like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. These are very, very expensive items – you mentioned the labels Prada, Versace, Gucci, Supreme – while it’s basically about looking simultaneously like you’ve made no effort, but the underlying thing is you do need to see the effort has gone in there.</p><p>Rob<br>Wow, this fashion trend does involve a lot of effort! It’s not just about looking messy – like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. Rummaging is when you search for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things.</p><p>Catherine<br>No don’t be rummaging! The trick seems to be to look like you’ve not made any effort but at the same time, you’re show you have made an effort! And that’s the meaning of the word simultaneously – doing one thing at the same time as another thing.</p><p>Rob<br>And I guess by showing you’ve made an effort, you wear designer labels – showing you’ve paid lots of money.</p><p>Catherine<br>The issue here is clothes from charity shops are supposed to be cheap. Some people even buy these clothes because it is all they can afford – but the irony here is some people are choosing to pay lots and lots of money to look like they’re wearing second-hand clothes – and the charity shops aren’t making any money from it.</p><p>Rob<br>Well if you’re a fashion victim it’s something you have to do.</p><p>Catherine<br>And there’s one thing I have to do now and that’s give you the answer to today’s quiz question. So I asked you earlier when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK?</p><p>Rob<br>And I said 1948.</p><p>Catherine<br>And you are correct this week Rob. Well done! The very first shop, run by the charity Oxfam, opened its doors in Oxford in 1948, as a direct result of an appeal launched to help post-war Greece.</p><p>Rob<br>Very interesting. Right, let’s remind ourselves of some of today’s vocabulary, starting with the word donating which means ‘giving goods or money to an organisation or charity’.</p><p>Catherine<br>Then we mentioned founding fathers - a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation.</p><p>Rob<br>We also mentioned that Catherine was no fashion victim – a person who has to follow the latest fashion trends.</p><p>Catherine<br>Rummaging was a word that described searching for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things. And then we had simultaneously which means ‘doing one thing at the same time as doing something else’.</p><p>Rob<br>Well you can simultaneously listen to this programme and look at our website if you like. The web address is bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Catherine<br>But that’s all we have time for now. Join us again next time. Goodbye.</p><p>Rob<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Catherine.<br>你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Catherine。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And hello, I’m Rob.<br>大家好，我是 罗伯。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Now Rob, do you ever buy things at a charity shop?<br>现在 罗伯，你有没有在慈善商店买过东西？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes I do. They are a great place to pick up a bargain and I also donate items to charity shops too. And a charity shop, by the way, is a shop where people take their unwanted items and then the shop sells them and makes money and the money goes to the charity.<br>是的，我愿意。他们是讨价还价的好地方，我也向慈善商店捐赠物品。顺便说一句，慈善商店是人们拿走他们不需要的物品，然后商店出售它们并赚钱的商店，这些钱捐给了慈善机构。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Exactly that’s good to hear Rob, because donating – that’s giving money or goods to an organisation – helps charities raise money. And you might be interested to know that dressing up in second-hand clothes is back in fashion – well sort of - and that’s what we’re discussing today – is looking like you’re dressing in charity shops clothes a new fashion statement?<br>“ 听到 罗伯 说这句话真是太好了，因为捐赠 —— 即向组织提供资金或物品 —— 有助于慈善机构筹集资金。您可能有兴趣知道，穿着二手衣服又回来了 —— 嗯 —— 这就是我们今天要讨论的内容 —— 看起来像你在慈善商店穿衣服是一种新的时尚宣言吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>It should be interesting but first Catherine, aren’t you going to set me a question to answer – and not a second-hand one please!<br>这应该很有趣，但首先，凯瑟琳，你不打算给我一个问题来回答吗 —— 请不要是二手问题！</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>It’s a brand new question today Rob, for you and the listeners at home – do you know when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK? Was it in… a) 1928; b) 1948, or c) 1968?<br>罗伯，今天对于您和家里的听众来说，这是一个全新的问题 —— 您知道英国第一家官方慈善商店是什么时候开业的吗？是在……a） 1928 年；b） 1948 年，还是 c） 1968 年？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I’ll go for 1948.<br>我会选择 1948 年。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>OK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about charity shops and fashion. And there’s a new look in town, which some people are calling ‘scumbro’. Scumbro combines the word ‘scummy’ which means ‘dirty and messy’ with the word ‘bro’, which is an informal way of referring to a boy or man. So scumbro is a fashion for men – but women can adopt it too.<br>好的，我们稍后会找出答案。但现在回到我们关于慈善商店和时尚的讨论。镇上出现了一种新的面貌，有些人称之为 “scumbro”。Scumbro 将“scummy”一词与“bro”一词相结合，“bro”一词是称呼男孩或男人的非正式方式。所以 scumbro 是男性的时尚 —— 但女性也可以采用它。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>It’s a bit of an insulting name and here’s the odd thing about this new fashion style: Being scumbro is about buying expensive designer-brands that look like they are from a charity shop. Very odd!<br>这个名字有点侮辱人，这种新时尚风格的奇怪之处在于：成为渣男就是购买昂贵的设计师品牌，这些品牌看起来像是来自慈善商店的。很奇怪！</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, it’s something Amber Graafland knows about. She is the Fashion &amp; Beauty Director for the Daily Mirror newspaper and she’s been telling BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme all about it. So, how did this trend start?<br>嗯，这是 Amber Graafland 知道的事情。她是每日镜报的时尚与美容总监，她一直在向BBC广播4台的You and Yours节目讲述这一切。那么，这种趋势是如何开始的呢？</p><p>Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily Mirror(Amber Graafland，时尚与美容总监，每日镜报)<br>Well I think the name came from a Vanity Fair article, and I think Justin Bieber, the likes of Jonah Hill to thank for this look, Pete Davidson, who’s actually the fiancée of Ariana Grande – he’s definitely one of the founding fathers of scumbro. And I think, like most of these trends, they’re started by celebrities and then, I mean look, it’s been picked up by everybody by the sounds of things.<br>嗯，我认为这个名字来自《名利场》的一篇文章，我想贾斯汀·比伯，要感谢乔纳·希尔等人，皮特·戴维森，他实际上是阿丽亚娜·格兰德的未婚妻 —— 他绝对是渣男的创始人之一。我认为，就像大多数这些趋势一样，它们是由名人发起的，然后，我的意思是，它已经被每个人的声音所接受。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>OK, so the fashion magazine Vanity Fair invented the name but the trend has spread because celebrities have been dressing in this style.<br>好吧，时尚杂志《名利场》发明了这个名字，但这种趋势已经蔓延开来，因为名人一直在穿着这种风格。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Yes and Amber mentioned a number of celebrities who are the founding fathers of the trend – that’s a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation.<br>Yes and Amber 提到了一些名人，他们是这一趋势的奠基人 —— 这是一个用来描述提出想法或组织的人的术语。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, the trend has been picked up – or copied - by people who you might describe as fashion victims – people who have to follow the latest fashion trends.<br>是的，这种趋势已经被你描述为时尚受害者的人所接受或复制 —— 他们必须追随最新的时尚潮流。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well Rob, I’m no fashion victim – but I say, maybe, one day, I might want to look scumbro – or maybe scumsis! So how exactly should I dress?<br>好吧，罗伯，我不是时尚的受害者 —— 但我说，也许，有一天，我可能想看起来渣男 —— 或者可能是渣男！那么我到底应该怎么着装呢？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>OK, well let’s hear from Amber Graafland again. How does she describe the characteristics of this fashion trend?<br>好的，让我们再次听到 Amber Graafland 的声音。她如何描述这种时尚潮流的特点？</p><p>Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily Mirror(Amber Graafland，时尚与美容总监，每日镜报)<br>It’s all about wearing these oversized clothes that are overpriced and I think it’s not just about looking like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. These are very, very expensive items – you mentioned the labels Prada, Versace, Gucci, Supreme – while it’s basically about looking simultaneously like you’ve made no effort, but the underlying thing is you do need to see the effort has gone in there.<br>这一切都与穿着这些价格过高的超大号衣服有关，我认为这不仅仅是看起来像你在青少年的装扮盒中翻找过。这些都是非常非常昂贵的商品 —— 你提到了 Prada、Versace、Gucci、Supreme 等品牌 —— 虽然基本上看起来你没有付出任何努力，但潜在的问题是你确实需要看到努力已经在那里。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Wow, this fashion trend does involve a lot of effort! It’s not just about looking messy – like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. Rummaging is when you search for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things.<br>哇，这种时尚趋势确实需要付出很多努力！这不仅仅是看起来凌乱 —— 就像你在青少年的装扮盒里翻找一样。翻找是指您搜索与许多其他事物混合在一起的东西。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>No don’t be rummaging! The trick seems to be to look like you’ve not made any effort but at the same time, you’re show you have made an effort! And that’s the meaning of the word simultaneously – doing one thing at the same time as another thing.<br>不，不要翻找！诀窍似乎是看起来你没有付出任何努力，但与此同时，你表明你已经付出了努力！这就是这个词的含义 – 同时做一件事和另一件事。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I guess by showing you’ve made an effort, you wear designer labels – showing you’ve paid lots of money.<br>我想，通过表明你付出了努力，你佩戴了名牌 —— 表明你付出了很多钱。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>The issue here is clothes from charity shops are supposed to be cheap. Some people even buy these clothes because it is all they can afford – but the irony here is some people are choosing to pay lots and lots of money to look like they’re wearing second-hand clothes – and the charity shops aren’t making any money from it.<br>这里的问题是慈善商店的衣服应该很便宜。有些人甚至购买这些衣服，因为这是他们能负担得起的 —— 但具有讽刺意味的是，有些人选择花很多很多钱来看起来像他们穿着二手衣服 —— 而慈善商店并没有从中赚到任何钱。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well if you’re a fashion victim it’s something you have to do.<br>好吧，如果你是时尚界的受害者，这是你必须做的事情。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And there’s one thing I have to do now and that’s give you the answer to today’s quiz question. So I asked you earlier when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK?<br>我现在必须做一件事，那就是给你今天测验问题的答案。所以我刚才问你，英国第一家官方慈善商店是什么时候开业的？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I said 1948.<br>我说的是 1948 年。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And you are correct this week Rob. Well done! The very first shop, run by the charity Oxfam, opened its doors in Oxford in 1948, as a direct result of an appeal launched to help post-war Greece.<br>本周你是对的，罗伯。干的好！第一家商店由慈善机构乐施会经营，于 1948 年在牛津开业，这是为了帮助战后希腊而发起的呼吁的直接结果。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Very interesting. Right, let’s remind ourselves of some of today’s vocabulary, starting with the word donating which means ‘giving goods or money to an organisation or charity’.<br>非常有趣。好吧，让我们提醒自己今天的一些词汇，从“捐赠”这个词开始，意思是“向组织或慈善机构捐赠物品或金钱”。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Then we mentioned founding fathers - a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation.<br>然后我们提到了开国元勋 —— 一个用来描述发起一个想法或组织的人的术语。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>We also mentioned that Catherine was no fashion victim – a person who has to follow the latest fashion trends.<br>我们还提到，Catherine 不是时尚的受害者 —— 一个必须追随最新时尚潮流的人。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Rummaging was a word that described searching for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things. And then we had simultaneously which means ‘doing one thing at the same time as doing something else’.<br>Rummaging 这个词形容寻找与许多其他事物混在一起的东西。然后我们有了 同时，这意味着“在做一件事的同时做另一件事”。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well you can simultaneously listen to this programme and look at our website if you like. The web address is bbclearningenglish.com.<br>好吧，如果您愿意，您可以同时收听此节目并查看我们的网站。网址为 bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>But that’s all we have time for now. Join us again next time. Goodbye.<br>但这就是我们现在的全部时间。下次再来我们。再见。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Bye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2018/10/18/wechat-2018-10-18/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="donating"><a href="#donating" class="headerlink" title="donating"></a>donating</h4><p>giving goods or money to an organisation or charity<br>捐赠<br>向某个组织或慈善机构捐赠物品或金钱<br>He donated a large sum of money to the hospital.<br>他向医院捐赠了一大笔钱。</p><h4 id="founding-fathers"><a href="#founding-fathers" class="headerlink" title="founding fathers"></a>founding fathers</h4><p>people who start an idea or an organisation<br>开国元勋<br>创立某种思想或组织的人<br>The founding fathers of the United States established a new nation based on democratic principles.<br>美国的开国元勋们建立了一个基于民主原则的新国家。</p><h4 id="fashion-victim"><a href="#fashion-victim" class="headerlink" title="fashion victim"></a>fashion victim</h4><p>person who has to follow the latest fashion trends<br>时尚受害者<br>不得不追逐最新时尚潮流的人<br>She’s a real fashion victim, always buying the latest trends, regardless of cost or style.<br>她是个十足的时尚受害者，总是购买最新的潮流款式，不管价格或款式如何。</p><h4 id="rummaging"><a href="#rummaging" class="headerlink" title="rummaging"></a>rummaging</h4><p>searching for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things<br>翻找<br>在混杂着许多其他东西的东西里寻找某物<br>He was rummaging through the drawers looking for his passport.<br>他正在翻找抽屉寻找他的护照。</p><h4 id="simultaneously"><a href="#simultaneously" class="headerlink" title="simultaneously"></a>simultaneously</h4><p>doing one thing at the same time as doing something else<br>同时地<br>同时做两件事<br>They simultaneously translated and interpreted the speech.<br>他们同时翻译和口译了这篇演讲。</p><h4 id="donate"><a href="#donate" class="headerlink" title="donate"></a>donate</h4><p>to give goods or money to an organization or charity<br>捐赠<br>向某个组织或慈善机构捐赠物品或金钱<br>Many people donate blood regularly to help those in need.<br>许多人定期献血以帮助那些需要帮助的人。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>Rob, what generation are you?</p><p>Rob<br>Well what are my choices?</p><p>Neil<br>You can’t choose what generation you are, it depends on when you were born.</p><p>Rob<br>Oh, OK then, what are the different generations?</p><p>Neil<br>Well, there are baby boomers, who were born in between the 1940s and the early 1960s. Then there was Generation X, born between the mid1960s and the early 1980s. Then there is Generation Y, also known as millennials, born mid 1980s to late 1990s, and …</p><p>Rob<br>OK, let me guess, Generation Z? Born in the late nineties or early noughties?</p><p>Neil<br>You’re very smart. So, which one are you?</p><p>Rob<br>Ah, that would give away my age wouldn’t it! OK, I have to confess I am Generation X. And what about you Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes me too, Generation X. But today we’re going to focus on Generation Z, also known as Gen Z. What marks Gen Z in particular is that they are the social media generation. They have never known a time without social media.</p><p>Rob<br>Oh, poor them!</p><p>Neil<br>Mmm, well, that’s one view. Other opinions are available. Before we look at Gen-Z in more detail, a question though. No one can quite agree on who first used the term ‘social media’, but we do know from which decade it came. Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties, that is the first decade of the 21st Century. Rob, what’s your answer?</p><p>Rob<br>Well, come on, it’s quite a recent thing. It’s got to be c) the noughties.</p><p>Neil<br>We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now we’re going to hear from Hiral Patel who is an analyst for Barclays. She appeared on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and was asked whether there was much difference between millennials and Generation Z. Does she think they are the same or different?</p><p>Hiral Patel<br>Most people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them.</p><p>Neil<br>So Rob, does Hiral Patel think there is much difference between the two generations?</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, she does. But she comments that not everyone does. Millennial is a term that is used so frequently that many people think it refers to all young people. Gen-Z, she says are not mini-millennials, they are quite different and have their own values and preferences.</p><p>Neil<br>And this is important for consumer brands, for companies who want to sell to this generation. They need to cater for that generation, which means they need to provide goods that Gen Z want.</p><p>Rob<br>And she describes Gen Z as being tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers.</p><p>Neil<br>It’s a bit of a mouthful but essentially it means that they are extremely comfortable with modern technology and social media and as a result have a lot of information about what’s going on in the world. This makes them savvy.</p><p>Rob<br>And being savvy means being able to understand situations well and make clever decisions because of this knowledge.</p><p>Neil<br>Now I think I’m pretty savvy when it comes to modern connected technology and media, but I didn’t grow up with it, it’s new. For Gen Z, this level of technology is what is normal, it’s all around and always has been, it’s their norm, as Hiral Patel put it. Here she is again:</p><p>Hiral Patel<br>Most people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them.</p><p>Neil<br>Right time to review this week’s vocabulary, but first let’s have an answer to that quiz. In what decade was the term ‘social media’ first coined? Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties What did you say Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>Yeah, well I said c) the noughties.</p><p>Neil<br>You’re wrong. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 1990s is the answer. I’m sure most of you got that one correct. Right, now, the vocabulary.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes this week we’ve been talking about generations. This is a term used to describe people born in a particular period of time, usually, but not always a period of about 18 to 20 years.</p><p>Neil<br>And we were focussing on Generation Z or Gen Z which includes those born in the early noughties, which is the first decade of the 21st Century from 2000 to 2009.</p><p>Rob<br>The next expression was to cater for. This means to provide something that is needed or wanted for a particular group. And if you are trying to sell something, you need to cater for your target market.</p><p>Neil<br>And if your market is Gen Z you need to be aware that they are tech innate, hyper- informed. They have grown up with connected technology and are very knowledgeable.</p><p>Rob<br>This makes them extremely savvy. This adjective means smart and intelligent. In this context it means they are able to make smart decisions about what to buy because they are connected so many sources of information. And for Gen Z, this level of interaction and connectivity is the norm. It’s what is normal, what is usual for them. So where I struggle sometimes with modern life and technology - for Gen Z, it’s easy.</p><p>Neil<br>Well that may be true but I’m savvy enough to know that it’s time to end the programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.<br>你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I’m Rob.<br>我是 罗伯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Rob, what generation are you?<br>罗伯，你是哪一代人？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well what are my choices?<br>那么我有哪些选择呢？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You can’t choose what generation you are, it depends on when you were born.<br>你不能选择你是哪一代，这取决于你是什么时候出生的。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Oh, OK then, what are the different generations?<br>哦，好吧，有哪些不同的世代呢？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, there are baby boomers, who were born in between the 1940s and the early 1960s. Then there was Generation X, born between the mid1960s and the early 1980s. Then there is Generation Y, also known as millennials, born mid 1980s to late 1990s, and …<br>嗯，有婴儿潮一代，他们出生于 1940 年代到 1960 年代初之间。然后是 X 世代，出生于 1960 年代中期至 1980 年代初之间。然后是 Y 世代，也被称为千禧一代，出生于 1980 年代中期至 1990 年代后期，以及……</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>OK, let me guess, Generation Z? Born in the late nineties or early noughties?<br>好吧，让我猜猜，Z 世代？出生于 90 年代末还是 90 年代初？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You’re very smart. So, which one are you?<br>你很聪明。那么，你是哪一个呢？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Ah, that would give away my age wouldn’t it! OK, I have to confess I am Generation X. And what about you Neil?<br>啊，那会暴露我的年龄，不是吗！好吧，我不得不承认我是 X 世代。那你呢，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes me too, Generation X. But today we’re going to focus on Generation Z, also known as Gen Z. What marks Gen Z in particular is that they are the social media generation. They have never known a time without social media.<br>是的，我也是，X 世代。但今天我们将关注 Z 世代，也称为 Z 世代。Z 世代的特别之处在于他们是社交媒体一代。他们从未经历过没有社交媒体的时代。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Oh, poor them!<br>哦，可怜的他们！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Mmm, well, that’s one view. Other opinions are available. Before we look at Gen-Z in more detail, a question though. No one can quite agree on who first used the term ‘social media’, but we do know from which decade it came. Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties, that is the first decade of the 21st Century. Rob, what’s your answer?<br>嗯，嗯，这是一种观点。其他意见也可用。在我们更详细地研究 Z 世代之前，有一个问题。没有人能完全同意谁首先使用“社交媒体”这个词，但我们确实知道它来自哪个十年。是：a） 1980 年代；b） 1990 年代 c） 新世纪，即 21 世纪的第一个十年。罗伯，你的答案是什么？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, come on, it’s quite a recent thing. It’s got to be c) the noughties.<br>嗯，拜托，这是最近的事情。它必须是 c） 新世纪。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now we’re going to hear from Hiral Patel who is an analyst for Barclays. She appeared on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and was asked whether there was much difference between millennials and Generation Z. Does she think they are the same or different?<br>我们稍后会在节目中找到答案。现在，我们将听取巴克莱银行分析师 Hiral Patel 的发言。她出现在 BBC Radio 4 的 You and Yours 节目中，并被问及千禧一代和 Z 世代之间是否有太大差异。她认为它们是相同的还是不同的？</p><p>Hiral Patel(希拉尔·帕特尔)<br>Most people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them.<br>大多数人将 Z 世代视为迷你千禧一代 —— 那是因为人们对“千禧一代”这个词很着迷。我们的研究表明，Z 世代是不同的，他们有自己的一套价值观和偏好，消费品牌需要迎合这些价值观和偏好。我们的研究发现，Z 世代是天生的技术型、消息灵通的消费者，而且非常精明。我们今天生活的这个高度互联的世界对他们来说是一种新常态。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So Rob, does Hiral Patel think there is much difference between the two generations?<br>那么 罗伯，Hiral Patel 认为这两代人之间有很大差异吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, she does. But she comments that not everyone does. Millennial is a term that is used so frequently that many people think it refers to all young people. Gen-Z, she says are not mini-millennials, they are quite different and have their own values and preferences.<br>是的，她知道。但她评论说，并不是每个人都这样做。千禧一代是一个被频繁使用的术语，以至于许多人认为它指的是所有年轻人。她说，Z 世代不是迷你千禧一代，他们完全不同，有自己的价值观和偏好。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And this is important for consumer brands, for companies who want to sell to this generation. They need to cater for that generation, which means they need to provide goods that Gen Z want.<br>这对于消费品牌和想要向这一代销售产品的公司来说非常重要。他们需要迎合这一代人的需求，这意味着他们需要提供 Z 世代想要的商品。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And she describes Gen Z as being tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers.<br>她将 Z 世代描述为与生俱来的技术、消息灵通的消费者。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>It’s a bit of a mouthful but essentially it means that they are extremely comfortable with modern technology and social media and as a result have a lot of information about what’s going on in the world. This makes them savvy.<br>这有点拗口，但从本质上讲，这意味着他们对现代技术和社交媒体非常满意，因此有很多关于世界上正在发生的事情的信息。这使他们变得精明。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And being savvy means being able to understand situations well and make clever decisions because of this knowledge.<br>精明意味着能够很好地理解情况并因为这些知识而做出明智的决定。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now I think I’m pretty savvy when it comes to modern connected technology and media, but I didn’t grow up with it, it’s new. For Gen Z, this level of technology is what is normal, it’s all around and always has been, it’s their norm, as Hiral Patel put it. Here she is again:<br>现在我认为我对现代互联技术和媒体非常了解，但我不是伴随着它长大的，它是新的。对于 Z 世代来说，这种技术水平是正常的，正如 Hiral Patel 所说，它无处不在，而且一直都是，这是他们的常态。她又来了：</p><p>Hiral Patel(希拉尔·帕特尔)<br>Most people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 1990s is the answer. I’m sure most of you got that one correct. Right, now, the vocabulary.<br>你错了。也许不足为奇，1990 年代就是答案。我相信你们中的大多数人都猜对了。好了，现在，词汇。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes this week we’ve been talking about generations. This is a term used to describe people born in a particular period of time, usually, but not always a period of about 18 to 20 years.<br>是的，本周我们一直在谈论几代人。这是一个术语，用于描述在特定时期出生的人，通常但并不总是大约 18 到 20 年。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And we were focussing on Generation Z or Gen Z which includes those born in the early noughties, which is the first decade of the 21st Century from 2000 to 2009.<br>我们专注于 Z 世代或 Z 世代，包括出生在二十世纪初的人，即 21 世纪的第一个十年，从 2000 年到 2009 年。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>The next expression was to cater for. This means to provide something that is needed or wanted for a particular group. And if you are trying to sell something, you need to cater for your target market.<br>下一个表达是迎合。这意味着提供特定群体需要或想要的东西。如果你想卖东西，你需要迎合你的目标市场。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And if your market is Gen Z you need to be aware that they are tech innate, hyper- informed. They have grown up with connected technology and are very knowledgeable.<br>如果你的市场是 Z 世代，你需要意识到他们是技术天生的，消息灵通。他们在互联技术中长大，知识渊博。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>This makes them extremely savvy. This adjective means smart and intelligent. In this context it means they are able to make smart decisions about what to buy because they are connected so many sources of information. And for Gen Z, this level of interaction and connectivity is the norm. It’s what is normal, what is usual for them. So where I struggle sometimes with modern life and technology - for Gen Z, it’s easy.<br>这使他们非常精明。这个形容词的意思是聪明和聪明。在这种情况下，这意味着他们能够对购买什么做出明智的决定，因为他们连接了如此多的信息来源。对于 Z 世代来说，这种水平的互动和连接是常态。这是正常的，对他们来说是正常的。因此，我有时会与现代生活和技术作斗争 —— 对于 Z 世代来说，这很容易。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well that may be true but I’m savvy enough to know that it’s time to end the programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>Rob, it’s good to see you keeping up with fashion by wearing the high-vis jacket – although I have to say it is a bit dazzling.</p><p>Rob<br>Neil, I’m no fashion victim – this high-vis or high-visibility jacket is for safety. I wear it when I’m cycling around London and I’ve just forgotten to take it off.</p><p>Neil<br>And a fashion victim, by the way, is someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. But wearing high-vis clothing has become the latest fashion statement – that’s something you wear to attract attention and people who know something about fashion.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, I can assure you, I don’t wear my bright jacket to look cool but in today’s programme we’ll be discussing why some people do. But first Neil, have you got a question for us to think about?</p><p>Neil<br>OK, we know that fashions come and go but in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory? Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the 1990s?</p><p>Rob<br>I do remember these so I’ll say b) the 1980s.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about the oddest item of clothing to hit the catwalk this year - the humble hi-vis jacket.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, they were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they’re working in the road or directing traffic. So it’s strange to think that now people choose to wear them to be on-trend – that’s following the latest fashion.</p><p>Neil<br>Hannah Marriott is the Fashion Editor of the Guardian newspaper. She told the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours, why she thought people were turning to bright, luminous clothing. What was the reason?</p><p>Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The Guardian<br>There’s also just a trend at the moment for people wearing very bright things, very eye- catching things, it feels that with social media, you know, everyone’s scrolling down their Instagram screens at such speed and anything that sort of catches the eye, that seems yeah, like a bit of a talking point, something that’s going to get a bit of attention - those kind of trends are getting a bit more traction at the moment - than the sort of understated cashmere jumper kind of fashion.</p><p>Rob<br>So her reason is social media. In our fast-paced lives, we’re quickly scrolling through our social media feeds and people want to stand out, attract our attention and be noticed.</p><p>Neil<br>And these attention-seekers need to wear some eye-catching – something that will catch your eye and be noticed. High-vis clothing certainly does that!</p><p>Rob<br>Hannah mentioned that wearing something different creates a talking point – something that you or I may discuss at work or on social media – even if it is to say ‘that guys looks ridiculous’! And she also mentions that people are becoming interested in and accepting these kinds of trends – the word she used was traction.</p><p>Neil<br>Traction here means this fashion trend is starting to stick. Of course fashion comes at a price. While an ordinary high-vis vest used for workwear is normally affordable, when they’re sold as a fashion item they can go for much higher prices, particularly if they have a designer label showing on the front.</p><p>Rob<br>This raises an important question. We know that many people wearing high-vis jackets are doing important jobs, so does this fashion devalue what they’re doing?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, it’s something Hannah Marriott talked about. Let’s hear from her again. What word does she use to describe a difficult issue?</p><p>Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The Guardian<br>Every time fashion borrows from workwear, there’re always some sort of thorny issues around it - particularly when you’re charging £2000 for something that is actually very similar to, you know, a uniform that somebody might be wearing who doesn’t actually make that much money, you know, there’s obviously some thorny class issues there.</p><p>Neil<br>So she used the word thorny to describe the issue of things worn at work becoming expensive fashion items. Thorny issues are subjects that are difficult deal with. Here she particularly mentioned the issue of class – so different groups of people in society in different economic positions – some can afford clothing for fashion, others can only afford clothing for work.</p><p>Rob<br>And the other issue is that if everyone starts wearing high-vis clothing, then the people who need to stand out for their own safety may not stand out as easily.</p><p>Neil<br>And we wouldn’t want to miss you when you’re out cycling on your bike, Rob. But would we miss you if you were wearing a pair of leg warmers? Earlier I asked in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory. Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the1990s?</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, and I said b) the 1980s. It’s got to be right!</p><p>Neil<br>Well, you know your fashion, Rob – it was indeed the 1980s. Leg warmers were originally worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching, but in the early 1980s they became fashionable for teenage girls to wear.</p><p>Rob<br>OK, let’s move on and recap on some of the vocabulary we’ve mentioned today. Starting with fashion victim – that’s someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. Like that pair of red jeans you used to wear, Neil.</p><p>Neil<br>They, Rob, were on-trend – that means ‘in keeping up with the latest fashion’. Of course wearing something red is very eye-catching which means attracting attention and being noticed.</p><p>Rob<br>Next we mentioned traction. If something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular. And then we had understated. In fashion, this describes something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive.</p><p>Neil<br>And then we discussed the word thorny. A tree or bush with thorns is difficult to touch and handle and similarly a thorny issue is a subject that is difficult to deal with and discuss.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, we’ve covered some thorny and less thorny issues today but we know that fashions change and maybe high-vis fashion won’t be here forever.</p><p>Neil<br>That’s it for now but please join us next time for 6 Minute English. See you soon. Goodbye.</p><p>Rob<br>Bye bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.<br>你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I’m Rob.<br>我是 罗伯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Rob, it’s good to see you keeping up with fashion by wearing the high-vis jacket – although I have to say it is a bit dazzling.<br>罗伯，很高兴看到你穿着高可见度夹克跟上时尚 —— 尽管我不得不说它有点令人眼花缭乱。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Neil, I’m no fashion victim – this high-vis or high-visibility jacket is for safety. I wear it when I’m cycling around London and I’ve just forgotten to take it off.<br>Neil，我不是时尚的受害者 —— 这件高可见度或高能见度夹克是为了安全。我在伦敦骑自行车时戴着它，只是忘了摘下它。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And a fashion victim, by the way, is someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. But wearing high-vis clothing has become the latest fashion statement – that’s something you wear to attract attention and people who know something about fashion.<br>顺便说一句，时尚受害者是那些总是穿着被认为是时尚的东西的人，即使它实际上在他们身上看起来并不好。但穿着高可见度的衣服已经成为最新的时尚宣言 —— 这是你穿来吸引注意力和对时尚有所了解的人的东西。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, I can assure you, I don’t wear my bright jacket to look cool but in today’s programme we’ll be discussing why some people do. But first Neil, have you got a question for us to think about?<br>好吧，我可以向你保证，我穿上鲜艳的夹克并不是为了看起来很酷，但在今天的节目中，我们将讨论为什么有些人会这样做。但首先，Neil，您有没有一个问题要我们考虑？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, we know that fashions come and go but in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory? Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the 1990s?<br>好吧，我们知道时尚来来去去，但是在哪个十年里，暖腿套作为流行的时尚配饰佩戴？是不是……a） 1970 年代；b） 1980 年代还是 c） 1990 年代？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I do remember these so I’ll say b) the 1980s.<br>我确实记得这些，所以我会说 b） 1980 年代。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about the oddest item of clothing to hit the catwalk this year - the humble hi-vis jacket.<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时揭晓答案。现在让我们更多地谈谈今年 T 台上最奇怪的服装 —— 不起眼的高可见度夹克。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, they were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they’re working in the road or directing traffic. So it’s strange to think that now people choose to wear them to be on-trend – that’s following the latest fashion.<br>是的，为了安全起见，它们被设计为供骑自行车的人和行人以及需要在道路上工作或指挥交通的工人佩戴。所以，现在人们选择穿着它们来紧跟潮流，这很奇怪 —— 这是在追随最新的时尚。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hannah Marriott is the Fashion Editor of the Guardian newspaper. She told the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours, why she thought people were turning to bright, luminous clothing. What was the reason?<br>Hannah Marriott 是《卫报》的时尚编辑。她告诉 BBC Radio 4 节目 You and Yours，为什么她认为人们会转向明亮、发光的衣服。原因是什么？</p><p>Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The Guardian(Hannah Marriott，《卫报》时尚编辑)<br>There’s also just a trend at the moment for people wearing very bright things, very eye- catching things, it feels that with social media, you know, everyone’s scrolling down their Instagram screens at such speed and anything that sort of catches the eye, that seems yeah, like a bit of a talking point, something that’s going to get a bit of attention - those kind of trends are getting a bit more traction at the moment - than the sort of understated cashmere jumper kind of fashion.<br>目前还有一种趋势是，人们穿着非常明亮、非常引人注目的衣服，感觉有了社交媒体，你知道的，每个人都以如此快的速度向下滚动他们的 Instagram 屏幕，任何吸引眼球的东西，这似乎是的，就像一个话题，一些会得到一些关注的东西 —— 这些趋势目前越来越受欢迎 —— 而不是那种低调的羊绒毛衣那种时尚。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>So her reason is social media. In our fast-paced lives, we’re quickly scrolling through our social media feeds and people want to stand out, attract our attention and be noticed.<br>所以她的理由是社交媒体。在我们快节奏的生活中，我们快速浏览社交媒体信息，人们希望脱颖而出，吸引我们的注意力并引起注意。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And these attention-seekers need to wear some eye-catching – something that will catch your eye and be noticed. High-vis clothing certainly does that!<br>这些寻求关注的人需要穿一些引人注目的衣服 —— 一些会吸引你眼球并被注意到的东西。High-vis 服装当然可以做到这一点！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Hannah mentioned that wearing something different creates a talking point – something that you or I may discuss at work or on social media – even if it is to say ‘that guys looks ridiculous’! And she also mentions that people are becoming interested in and accepting these kinds of trends – the word she used was traction.<br>Hannah 提到，穿着不同的衣服会成为一个话题 —— 你或我可能会在工作中或社交媒体上讨论的东西 —— 即使是说“那些家伙看起来很荒谬”！她还提到，人们对这类趋势越来越感兴趣并接受 —— 她使用的词是牵引力。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Traction here means this fashion trend is starting to stick. Of course fashion comes at a price. While an ordinary high-vis vest used for workwear is normally affordable, when they’re sold as a fashion item they can go for much higher prices, particularly if they have a designer label showing on the front.<br>这里的牵引力意味着这种时尚趋势开始流行起来。当然，时尚是有代价的。虽然用于工作服的普通高可见度背心通常价格实惠，但当它们作为时尚单品出售时，它们的价格可能会高得多，特别是如果它们的正面有设计师品牌。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>This raises an important question. We know that many people wearing high-vis jackets are doing important jobs, so does this fashion devalue what they’re doing?<br>这就提出了一个重要的问题。我们知道，许多穿着高可见度夹克的人都在做重要的工作，那么这种时尚是否贬低了他们正在做的事情的价值呢？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, it’s something Hannah Marriott talked about. Let’s hear from her again. What word does she use to describe a difficult issue?<br>是的，这是 Hannah Marriott 谈到的事情。让我们再次听到她的心声。她用什么词来形容一个难题？</p><p>Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The Guardian(Hannah Marriott，《卫报》时尚编辑)<br>Every time fashion borrows from workwear, there’re always some sort of thorny issues around it - particularly when you’re charging £2000 for something that is actually very similar to, you know, a uniform that somebody might be wearing who doesn’t actually make that much money, you know, there’s obviously some thorny class issues there.<br>每次时尚借鉴工作服时，总会有一些棘手的问题 —— 尤其是当你收取 2000 英镑的价格买一件实际上非常相似的东西时，你知道，某人可能穿着的制服实际上赚不到那么多钱，你知道，那里显然存在一些棘手的阶级问题。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So she used the word thorny to describe the issue of things worn at work becoming expensive fashion items. Thorny issues are subjects that are difficult deal with. Here she particularly mentioned the issue of class – so different groups of people in society in different economic positions – some can afford clothing for fashion, others can only afford clothing for work.<br>所以她用 thorny 这个词来描述工作时穿的东西变成昂贵的时尚单品的问题。棘手的问题是难以处理的话题。在这里，她特别提到了阶级问题 —— 因此社会上处于不同经济地位的不同群体 —— 有些人买得起时尚服装，有些人只能买得起工作用的衣服。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And the other issue is that if everyone starts wearing high-vis clothing, then the people who need to stand out for their own safety may not stand out as easily.<br>另一个问题是，如果每个人都开始穿着高可见度的衣服，那么需要为了自身安全而脱颖而出的人可能不会那么容易脱颖而出。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And we wouldn’t want to miss you when you’re out cycling on your bike, Rob. But would we miss you if you were wearing a pair of leg warmers? Earlier I asked in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory. Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the1990s?<br>当您骑自行车外出时，我们不想错过您，罗伯。但是，如果您穿着一双护腿套，我们会想念您吗？早些时候，我问护腿套是哪十年的流行时尚配饰。是不是……a） 1970 年代；b） 1980 年代还是 c） 1990 年代？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, and I said b) the 1980s. It’s got to be right!<br>是的，我说的是 b） 1980 年代。它必须是正确的！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, you know your fashion, Rob – it was indeed the 1980s. Leg warmers were originally worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching, but in the early 1980s they became fashionable for teenage girls to wear.<br>嗯，你知道你的时尚，罗伯 - 那确实是 1980 年代。暖腿套最初是舞者穿着的，以防止她们的肌肉在伸展后抽筋，但在 1980 年代初期，它们成为十几岁女孩穿的时尚。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>OK, let’s move on and recap on some of the vocabulary we’ve mentioned today. Starting with fashion victim – that’s someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. Like that pair of red jeans you used to wear, Neil.<br>好，让我们继续回顾我们今天提到的一些词汇。从时尚受害者开始 —— 那是总是穿着被认为是时尚的衣服的人，即使它实际上穿在他们身上并不好看。就像你以前穿的那条红色牛仔裤一样，Neil。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>They, Rob, were on-trend – that means ‘in keeping up with the latest fashion’. Of course wearing something red is very eye-catching which means attracting attention and being noticed.<br>他们，罗伯，紧跟潮流 —— 这意味着“跟上最新的时尚”。当然，穿红色衣服非常引人注目，这意味着吸引注意力并被注意到。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Next we mentioned traction. If something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular. And then we had understated. In fashion, this describes something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive.<br>接下来我们提到了牵引力。如果某件事获得牵引力，它就会被接受和流行。然后我们就低估了。在时尚界，这描述了不引起注意且不那么令人印象深刻的事物。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And then we discussed the word thorny. A tree or bush with thorns is difficult to touch and handle and similarly a thorny issue is a subject that is difficult to deal with and discuss.<br>然后我们讨论了 thorny 这个词。长有荆棘的树木或灌木丛很难触摸和处理，同样，棘手的问题也是一个难以处理和讨论的话题。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, we’ve covered some thorny and less thorny issues today but we know that fashions change and maybe high-vis fashion won’t be here forever.<br>好吧，我们今天已经讨论了一些棘手和不那么棘手的问题，但我们知道时尚会发生变化，也许高可见度的时尚不会永远存在。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That’s it for now but please join us next time for 6 Minute English. See you soon. Goodbye.<br>现在就到这里了，但请下次加入我们的六分钟英语。一会见。再见。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Bye bye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2018/09/27/wechat-2018-09-27/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="fashion-victim"><a href="#fashion-victim" class="headerlink" title="fashion victim"></a>fashion victim</h4><p>someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them<br>时尚牺牲品<br>总是穿着被认为时尚的东西的人，即使它实际上并不适合他们<br>She’s a real fashion victim, always chasing the latest trends regardless of whether they suit her.<br>她是个不折不扣的时尚牺牲品，总是追逐最新的潮流，不管是否适合她。</p><h4 id="on-trend"><a href="#on-trend" class="headerlink" title="on-trend"></a>on-trend</h4><p>in keeping up with the latest fashion<br>当季流行的<br>紧跟最新时尚<br>Her on-trend outfit showcased the season’s hottest colours and silhouettes.<br>她那身当季流行的服装展现了本季最热门的颜色和轮廓。</p><h4 id="eye-catching"><a href="#eye-catching" class="headerlink" title="eye-catching"></a>eye-catching</h4><p>attracting attention and being noticed<br>引人注目的<br>吸引注意力并被注意到<br>The eye-catching display in the shop window drew many passersby to a halt.<br>商店橱窗里引人注目的展示吸引了许多路人驻足观看。</p><h4 id="traction"><a href="#traction" class="headerlink" title="traction"></a>traction</h4><p>if something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular<br>获得关注<br>如果某事获得关注，它就会被接受和流行起来<br>The new policy is slowly gaining traction among the public.<br>这项新政策正在逐渐获得公众的关注。</p><h4 id="understated"><a href="#understated" class="headerlink" title="understated"></a>understated</h4><p>(fashion) something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive<br>低调的<br>（时尚）不会引起注意，也不那么令人印象深刻<br>Her understated elegance was far more appealing than flamboyant displays of wealth.<br>她低调的优雅远比炫耀财富更吸引人。</p><h4 id="thorny"><a href="#thorny" class="headerlink" title="thorny"></a>thorny</h4><p>a thorny issue is a subject that is difficult to deal with and discuss<br>棘手的<br>棘手的问题是一个难以处理和讨论的话题<br>The issue of climate change is a thorny one, demanding international cooperation.<br>气候变化问题是一个棘手的问题，需要国际合作。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>Rob, would you say that were a snowflake?</p><p>Rob<br>Wow, I can’t believe you said that, that’s so offensive. How could you be so rude?</p><p>Neil<br>So I guess that’s a yes then? Sorry, I only asked.</p><p>Rob<br>Don’t worry, I wasn’t really upset, I just wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the word. The word snowflake has taken on a new meaning in recent years. These days it’s used as an insult. It’s used to criticise people or groups that are seen to be very easily offended or upset by things that others say.</p><p>Neil<br>There is usually a political side to it too, isn’t there?</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, people who use the word snowflake tend to be from the political right and they usually use it about those on the political left, particularly millennials - young, socially aware adults.</p><p>Neil<br>Well we’ll explore this topic in more detail shortly, but first a quiz question. In which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, we said it’s quite a recent word so I’m going for c) 2016.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out if you’re right later on in the programme. The topic of offence is a very complicated one. First what do we mean by offence Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>Thanks for that. That is a really difficult question. Something that is offensive is rude, insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset. What’s difficult about it though is that we don’t all find the same things offensive. Some people can be deliberately offensive and some people may be offensive without meaning to be.</p><p>Neil<br>Also, different people respond to offence in different ways - some accept it as the price of free speech and some try to stop the people they think are offensive from saying the things they do.</p><p>Rob<br>These terms come up quite a lot in discussions about equality, race, religion and of course, politics.</p><p>Neil<br>The topic was discussed in detail in the BBC Radio programme Sweet Reason. Evan Davis presented the programme and here is the first part of his summary of the discussion. What does he say is the reason some people talk about offence?</p><p>Evan Davis<br>First, on occasion, people probably do invoke offence when really they just have a political disagreement and on occasion groups that suffer discrimination or exclusion perhaps find it exhilarating or uniting to call out that discrimination.</p><p>Neil<br>He says that some people take offence when it’s just a political disagreement. He says they invoke offence.</p><p>Rob<br>If you invoke something it means that you use it to support your point or explain your action. So to invoke offence is to say that we are acting this way because we are offended by what you have said, although the offence may only be a political difference rather than something truly offensive.</p><p>Neil<br>Davis goes on to say that groups that do suffer from discrimination may get some feelings of unity when they call out discrimination. They feel more together when they publicise and highlight the discrimination they have experienced. Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine, that doesn’t mean people don’t have a right to be offended. Here’s Evan Davis again.</p><p>Evan Davis<br>Where the so-called snowflakes surely have a point is this, societies are entitled to make certain things taboo and the millennials use of the word offensive is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong they are in a special category of wrong.</p><p>Rob<br>His point here is that societies can decide that certain things are taboo. In this context something that is taboo is something that is regarded by society as being shocking and offensive and that it is OK for people to be offended by these things.</p><p>Neil<br>And I think the point he makes is a good one. The word snowflake is usually used as an insult - but some people may feel proud to be a snowflake because it means they are standing up for a particular standard, they have a level of decency and social responsibility that is higher than that of those who are calling them snowflakes.</p><p>Rob<br>Well I hope we haven’t caused any offence today. Before we review the vocabulary, can we have the answer to today’s question Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Of course, I asked in which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016.</p><p>Rob<br>And I said c) 2016. It’s got to be right!</p><p>Neil<br>Well, do you want to hear the story? Interestingly the term was coined in 1996 in the book Fight Club, but it was in 2016 that it was one of the dictionary’s words of the year. Now let’s review our words of the day. First there is offence.</p><p>Rob<br>People can take offence and be offended by something that is offensive. Something that is offensive could be rude, insulting and shocking. It might take the form of humiliation or discrimination against a person or group.</p><p>Neil<br>The term snowflake is a word used by some people to talk about other people who they think get offended too easily and unnecessarily. They don’t want to change their language or ideas just because snowflakes get upset. Then we had the word invoke. If you invoke something you use it as a reason to explain your actions and feelings.</p><p>Rob<br>To call something out is to challenge it, to highlight it and look for justification.</p><p>Neil<br>And finally we have taboo. Something that society says is offensive and shocking. So there we have it. What do you think Rob of this topic.</p><p>Rob<br>Well it is a very difficult subject, particularly when it comes to politics, religion and society. Free speech is good but at times, particularly on social media, I think can be unnecessarily unpleasant.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, try not to be offended but it is time for us to leave you for this programme. Do join us next time. Remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. And of course, we have a new app which you can find on our website. It’s free and it’s brilliant isn’t it Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>Absolutely!</p><p>Neil<br>See you soon, bye.</p><p>Rob<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.<br>你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I’m Rob.<br>我是 罗伯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Rob, would you say that were a snowflake?<br>罗伯，你会说那是一片雪花吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Wow, I can’t believe you said that, that’s so offensive. How could you be so rude?<br>哇，我真不敢相信你这么说，这太冒犯了。你怎么能这么粗鲁呢？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So I guess that’s a yes then? Sorry, I only asked.<br>所以我想这是肯定的吗？对不起，我只是问了。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Don’t worry, I wasn’t really upset, I just wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the word. The word snowflake has taken on a new meaning in recent years. These days it’s used as an insult. It’s used to criticise people or groups that are seen to be very easily offended or upset by things that others say.<br>别担心，我并不是真的不高兴，我只是想演示这个词的含义。近年来，雪花这个词有了新的含义。如今，它被用作侮辱。它被用来批评那些被认为很容易被别人所说的话冒犯或不安的人或团体。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>There is usually a political side to it too, isn’t there?<br>它通常也有政治的一面，不是吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, people who use the word snowflake tend to be from the political right and they usually use it about those on the political left, particularly millennials - young, socially aware adults.<br>是的，使用雪花这个词的人往往来自政治右翼，他们通常用它来指代政治左翼人士，尤其是千禧一代 —— 年轻的、有社会意识的成年人。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well we’ll explore this topic in more detail shortly, but first a quiz question. In which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016.<br>好吧，我们稍后将更详细地探讨这个主题，但首先是一个测验问题。snowflake 是哪一年的 Collins Dictionary 年度词汇之一？是不是……a） 1996 年；b） 2006 c） 2016 年。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, we said it’s quite a recent word so I’m going for c) 2016.<br>嗯，我们说这是一个很新的词，所以我选择 c） 2016。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out if you’re right later on in the programme. The topic of offence is a very complicated one. First what do we mean by offence Rob?<br>好吧，我们稍后会发现您在该计划中是否正确。冒犯的话题是一个非常复杂的话题。首先，我们所说的冒犯 罗伯 是什么意思？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Thanks for that. That is a really difficult question. Something that is offensive is rude, insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset. What’s difficult about it though is that we don’t all find the same things offensive. Some people can be deliberately offensive and some people may be offensive without meaning to be.<br>谢谢你。这是一个非常困难的问题。冒犯性的东西是粗鲁的、侮辱性的，会让人感到受伤和不安。然而，困难的是，我们并不都觉得同样的事情令人反感。有些人可能会故意冒犯，有些人可能会无意冒犯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Also, different people respond to offence in different ways - some accept it as the price of free speech and some try to stop the people they think are offensive from saying the things they do.<br>此外，不同的人对冒犯的反应也不同 —— 有些人认为这是言论自由的代价，有些人试图阻止他们认为冒犯的人说出他们所做的事情。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>These terms come up quite a lot in discussions about equality, race, religion and of course, politics.<br>这些术语在关于平等、种族、宗教，当然还有政治的讨论中经常出现。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The topic was discussed in detail in the BBC Radio programme Sweet Reason. Evan Davis presented the programme and here is the first part of his summary of the discussion. What does he say is the reason some people talk about offence?<br>BBC 广播节目 Sweet Reason 详细讨论了这个话题。Evan Davis 介绍了该计划，以下是他对讨论的总结的第一部分。他说有些人谈论冒犯的原因是什么？</p><p>Evan Davis(埃文·戴维斯)<br>First, on occasion, people probably do invoke offence when really they just have a political disagreement and on occasion groups that suffer discrimination or exclusion perhaps find it exhilarating or uniting to call out that discrimination.<br>首先，有时人们可能确实会援引冒犯，而实际上他们只是存在政治分歧，有时遭受歧视或排斥的群体可能会觉得大声疾呼这种歧视令人振奋或团结起来。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>He says that some people take offence when it’s just a political disagreement. He says they invoke offence.<br>他说，当这只是政治分歧时，有些人会感到冒犯。他说他们引发了冒犯。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>If you invoke something it means that you use it to support your point or explain your action. So to invoke offence is to say that we are acting this way because we are offended by what you have said, although the offence may only be a political difference rather than something truly offensive.<br>如果你引用了某项内容，则意味着你用它来支持你的观点或解释你的操作。因此，援引冒犯就是说我们之所以这样做，是因为我们对你所说的话感到冒犯，尽管冒犯可能只是政治上的分歧，而不是真正冒犯性的东西。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Davis goes on to say that groups that do suffer from discrimination may get some feelings of unity when they call out discrimination. They feel more together when they publicise and highlight the discrimination they have experienced. Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine, that doesn’t mean people don’t have a right to be offended. Here’s Evan Davis again.<br>戴维斯继续说，确实遭受歧视的群体在大声疾呼歧视时可能会获得一些团结的感觉。当他们宣传和强调他们所经历的歧视时，他们会感觉更加团结。即使受到的一些冒犯可能不是真实的，但这并不意味着人们没有权利被冒犯。埃文·戴维斯 又来了。</p><p>Evan Davis(埃文·戴维斯)<br>Where the so-called snowflakes surely have a point is this, societies are entitled to make certain things taboo and the millennials use of the word offensive is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong they are in a special category of wrong.<br>所谓的雪花肯定有道理，社会有权将某些事情定为禁忌，而千禧一代使用冒犯性这个词只是为了说一些观点不仅是错误的，而且属于一类特殊的错误。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>His point here is that societies can decide that certain things are taboo. In this context something that is taboo is something that is regarded by society as being shocking and offensive and that it is OK for people to be offended by these things.<br>他在这里的观点是，社会可以决定某些事情是禁忌。在这种情况下，禁忌的东西就是被社会视为令人震惊和冒犯的东西，人们被这些事情冒犯是可以的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And I think the point he makes is a good one. The word snowflake is usually used as an insult - but some people may feel proud to be a snowflake because it means they are standing up for a particular standard, they have a level of decency and social responsibility that is higher than that of those who are calling them snowflakes.<br>我认为他提出的观点很好。雪花这个词通常被用作侮辱 —— 但有些人可能会为自己是雪花而感到自豪，因为这意味着他们正在捍卫特定的标准，他们的体面和社会责任水平高于那些称他们为雪花的人。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well I hope we haven’t caused any offence today. Before we review the vocabulary, can we have the answer to today’s question Neil?<br>好吧，我希望我们今天没有引起任何冒犯。在我们回顾词汇之前，我们能回答今天的问题吗 尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Of course, I asked in which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016.<br>当然，我问雪花是哪一年的柯林斯词典年度词汇之一？是不是……a） 1996 年；b） 2006 c） 2016 年。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I said c) 2016. It’s got to be right!<br>我说 c） 2016 年。它必须是正确的！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, do you want to hear the story? Interestingly the term was coined in 1996 in the book Fight Club, but it was in 2016 that it was one of the dictionary’s words of the year. Now let’s review our words of the day. First there is offence.<br>那么，你想听这个故事吗？有趣的是，这个词是在 1996 年的《搏击俱乐部》一书中创造的，但直到 2016 年，它才成为词典的年度词汇之一。现在让我们回顾一下我们今天的词汇。首先是冒犯。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>People can take offence and be offended by something that is offensive. Something that is offensive could be rude, insulting and shocking. It might take the form of humiliation or discrimination against a person or group.<br>人们可能会因为冒犯性的事情而受到冒犯和冒犯。冒犯性的内容可能是粗鲁的、侮辱性的和令人震惊的。它可能表现为对个人或群体的羞辱或歧视。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The term snowflake is a word used by some people to talk about other people who they think get offended too easily and unnecessarily. They don’t want to change their language or ideas just because snowflakes get upset. Then we had the word invoke. If you invoke something you use it as a reason to explain your actions and feelings.<br>雪花一词是一些人用来谈论他们认为太容易和不必要地被冒犯的其他人的词。他们不想仅仅因为雪花不安就改变他们的语言或想法。然后我们有了 invoke 这个词。如果你援引某样东西，你就把它作为解释你的行为和感受的理由。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>To call something out is to challenge it, to highlight it and look for justification.<br>指出某件事就是挑战它，突出它并寻找理由。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And finally we have taboo. Something that society says is offensive and shocking. So there we have it. What do you think Rob of this topic.<br>最后，我们有禁忌。社会所说的令人反感和震惊的东西。所以我们有了它。你觉得这个话题的 罗伯 怎么样。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well it is a very difficult subject, particularly when it comes to politics, religion and society. Free speech is good but at times, particularly on social media, I think can be unnecessarily unpleasant.<br>嗯，这是一个非常困难的话题，尤其是在政治、宗教和社会方面。言论自由是好的，但有时，尤其是在社交媒体上，我认为可能会带来不必要的不愉快。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, try not to be offended but it is time for us to leave you for this programme.

And welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Dan.</p><p>Rob<br>And hello, I’m Rob.</p><p>Dan<br>In today’s programme we’re going to be looking at what our brains are doing when we are using dating apps. Now, Rob, have you ever used a dating app?</p><p>Rob<br>No way, I would never use one.</p><p>Dan<br>Hmm, so Rob, can you explain, when talking about dating apps, what we mean by swipe left and swipe right?</p><p>Rob<br>Ah, yes. These are not new words but technology has given them new meaning. To swipe is the movement of your finger on a smartphone to change the screen you’re looking at. So imagine turning the page in a book, well, on a phone, you swipe. In some dating apps, they show you pictures of people you might find attractive. If you do like them, you swipe right. If you don’t like them, you swipe left.</p><p>Dan<br>We will dig deeper into this topic shortly, but first, a question. In the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five What do you think?</p><p>Rob<br>Well, all of those seem quite high to me, so I’m going to guess in the middle, one in four.</p><p>Dan<br>Well, we’ll find out if you’re right later in the programme. Now, Alice Gray is a science communicator and blogger. Recently she was a guest on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour programme and she was asked about what goes on in our brains when we use dating apps compared to when we meet people in real life. What difference does she say there is?</p><p>Alice Gray<br>It’s very easy to think that with these instantaneous swipe left, swipe right, that the process in our brain of how we pick out a suitable mate would be very different, when actually it’s really similar to how we do it in person.</p><p>Rob<br>So she says that what goes on in our brains is actually very similar. Online we make decisions very quickly about who we like. These decisions are almost immediate - she used the adjective instantaneous for this. So we make these instantaneous decisions then choose to swipe left or swipe right. In real life, we do the same thing. We know almost immediately when we see someone if we find them attractive or not.</p><p>Dan<br>Although of course in digital dating, one you’ve swiped left you will never see that person again and you won’t have the chance to meet. In the real world you could meet someone you don’t find attractive instantaneously and then get to know them and find that you do quite like them.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, that is true, but then possibly they won’t like you. And then you have to deal with rejection. Rejection is when someone doesn’t find you attractive and they don’t want to spend time with you or get to know you.</p><p>Dan<br>So what’s the difference in our brains between online rejection and real life rejection? Here’s Alice Gray again.</p><p>Alice Gray<br>We see that a lot of the patterns associated with rejection in real life and rejection on dating apps are similar, just the exposure to the rate of the amount of rejection you get on dating apps is a lot higher than the ones in real life. So in real life you’ll have time to, sort of, compute the rejection, get over it a little bit, and dust yourself off and get on with it. Whereas the rate of rejection on dating apps is so high it’s often hard to cope with one coming in after another.</p><p>Rob<br>So, she says that our brain’s response to real life and online rejection is quite similar, but in the digital world you can be rejected many more times.</p><p>Dan<br>In real life you have a bit more time to recover from the rejection, to get over it, as she says. You can dust yourself off which is a way of saying you think positively to make yourself feel better - imagine falling over on the ground, when you get up, you might be covered in dust and dirt, you need to dust yourself off to make yourself ready again, before you carry on.</p><p>Rob<br>In the online world though, you don’t have that time. Online dating apps can lead to many rejections and psychologically that can be difficult to manage. Another way of saying ‘difficult to manage’ is difficult to cope with.</p><p>Dan<br>Well, we don’t want you to reject us, so time now to give you the answer to that quiz question before a recap of today’s vocabulary. I asked: in the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five.</p><p>Rob<br>Hmmm, so I said b) one in four – 25%. Was I right?</p><p>Dan<br>Sorry, Rob, the answer is a), one in three. Does that surprise you?</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, it does, I didn’t think it would be that high.</p><p>Dan<br>It’s the sign of the times, Rob. Digital world – digital dating! Let’s have a look at that vocabulary.</p><p>Rob<br>OK, well, we started with the verb to swipe. The movement of our finger on smartphone or tablet screen to indicate whether we like someone or not. Swipe right for like, swipe left if you don’t like.</p><p>Dan<br>Our decisions on whether we find someone attractive or not are often instantaneous. This adjective means immediate, at once.</p><p>Rob<br>Rejection is when you let someone know that you are not interested in them, you don’t want to be romantically involved with them.</p><p>Dan<br>If you are rejected you might need some time to feel better, and for this you can use the phrasal verb get over. It can take some time to get over a rejection.</p><p>Rob<br>Yeah, I know! Being positive and optimistic after a rejection can be described as dusting yourself off. But, having many rejections can be difficult to cope with, which means it can be difficult to manage, difficult to keep positive.</p><p>Dan<br>Well, we hope you don’t swipe left on this programme and you will join us again next time Remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Rob<br>And don’t forget our new BBC Learning English app.</p><p>Dan<br>Oh good idea. See you soon. Bye.</p><p>Rob<br>Bye bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Dan(担)<br>Hello. And welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Dan.<br>你好。欢迎来到六分钟英语。我是 Dan。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And hello, I’m Rob.<br>大家好，我是 罗伯。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>In today’s programme we’re going to be looking at what our brains are doing when we are using dating apps. Now, Rob, have you ever used a dating app?<br>在今天的节目中，我们将看看当我们使用约会应用节目时，我们的大脑在做什么。现在，罗伯，你用过约会应用吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>No way, I would never use one.<br>不可能，我永远不会用。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Hmm, so Rob, can you explain, when talking about dating apps, what we mean by swipe left and swipe right?<br>嗯，那么 罗伯，您能否解释一下，在谈论约会应用程序时，我们所说的向左滑动和向右滑动是什么意思？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Ah, yes. These are not new words but technology has given them new meaning. To swipe is the movement of your finger on a smartphone to change the screen you’re looking at. So imagine turning the page in a book, well, on a phone, you swipe. In some dating apps, they show you pictures of people you might find attractive. If you do like them, you swipe right. If you don’t like them, you swipe left.<br>啊，是的。这些不是新词，但技术赋予了它们新的含义。滑动是您在智能手机上的手指移动以更改您正在查看的屏幕。所以想象一下，在书中翻页，嗯，在手机上，你滑动。在一些约会应用程序中，他们会向您展示您可能会觉得有吸引力的人的照片。如果你喜欢他们，你可以向右滑动。如果你不喜欢他们，你可以向左滑动。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>We will dig deeper into this topic shortly, but first, a question. In the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five What do you think?<br>我们稍后将深入探讨这个话题，但首先是一个问题。在英国，大约有多少婚姻是从这对夫妇在网上见面开始的？是：a） 三分之一；b） 四分之一 c） 五分之一 你怎么看？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, all of those seem quite high to me, so I’m going to guess in the middle, one in four.<br>嗯，所有这些在我看来都相当高，所以我猜一下，四分之一。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Well, we’ll find out if you’re right later in the programme. Now, Alice Gray is a science communicator and blogger. Recently she was a guest on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour programme and she was asked about what goes on in our brains when we use dating apps compared to when we meet people in real life. What difference does she say there is?<br>好吧，我们将在该计划的后面发现您是否正确。现在，Alice Gray 是一名科学传播者和博主。最近，她做客了 BBC Radio 4 的 Woman’s Hour 节目，她被问及当我们使用约会应用节目时，与在现实生活中认识人时相比，我们的大脑中发生了什么。她说有什么区别呢？</p><p>Alice Gray(爱丽丝·格雷)<br>It’s very easy to think that with these instantaneous swipe left, swipe right, that the process in our brain of how we pick out a suitable mate would be very different, when actually it’s really similar to how we do it in person.<br>我们很容易认为，通过这些瞬间向左滑动、向右滑动，我们大脑中如何挑选合适伴侣的过程会非常不同，而实际上这与我们亲自做事的方式非常相似。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>So she says that what goes on in our brains is actually very similar. Online we make decisions very quickly about who we like. These decisions are almost immediate - she used the adjective instantaneous for this. So we make these instantaneous decisions then choose to swipe left or swipe right. In real life, we do the same thing. We know almost immediately when we see someone if we find them attractive or not.<br>所以她说，我们大脑中发生的事情实际上非常相似。在网上，我们很快就决定了我们喜欢谁。这些决定几乎是立竿见影的 —— 她为此使用了形容词 instantaneous。因此，我们立即做出这些决定，然后选择向左滑动或向右滑动。在现实生活中，我们做同样的事情。当我们看到某人时，我们几乎立即知道我们是否觉得他们有吸引力。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Although of course in digital dating, one you’ve swiped left you will never see that person again and you won’t have the chance to meet. In the real world you could meet someone you don’t find attractive instantaneously and then get to know them and find that you do quite like them.<br>当然，在数字约会中，您向左滑动的约会将永远不会再看到那个人，您也没有机会见面。在现实世界中，您可能会立即遇到一个您认为没有吸引力的人，然后了解他们并发现您确实非常喜欢他们。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, that is true, but then possibly they won’t like you. And then you have to deal with rejection. Rejection is when someone doesn’t find you attractive and they don’t want to spend time with you or get to know you.<br>是的，这是真的，但那样的话，他们可能不会喜欢你。然后你必须面对拒绝。拒绝是指有人觉得你没有吸引力，他们不想花时间和你在一起或了解你。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>So what’s the difference in our brains between online rejection and real life rejection? Here’s Alice Gray again.<br>那么，在我们的大脑中，在线拒绝和现实生活中的拒绝有什么区别呢？又是 Alice Gray。</p><p>Alice Gray(爱丽丝·格雷)<br>We see that a lot of the patterns associated with rejection in real life and rejection on dating apps are similar, just the exposure to the rate of the amount of rejection you get on dating apps is a lot higher than the ones in real life. So in real life you’ll have time to, sort of, compute the rejection, get over it a little bit, and dust yourself off and get on with it. Whereas the rate of rejection on dating apps is so high it’s often hard to cope with one coming in after another.<br>我们看到，与现实生活中的拒绝和约会应用程序上的拒绝相关的许多模式是相似的，只是你在约会应用程序上被拒绝的比率比现实生活中的要高得多。所以在现实生活中，你会有时间，在某种程度上，计算一下被拒绝的情况，稍微克服它，然后掸掉身上的灰尘，继续前进。虽然约会应用程序的拒绝率如此之高，但通常很难应对一个接一个的进来。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>So, she says that our brain’s response to real life and online rejection is quite similar, but in the digital world you can be rejected many more times.<br>所以，她说我们的大脑对现实生活和在线拒绝的反应非常相似，但在数字世界中，你可能会被拒绝很多次。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>In real life you have a bit more time to recover from the rejection, to get over it, as she says. You can dust yourself off which is a way of saying you think positively to make yourself feel better - imagine falling over on the ground, when you get up, you might be covered in dust and dirt, you need to dust yourself off to make yourself ready again, before you carry on.<br>正如她所说，在现实生活中，你有更多的时间从拒绝中恢复过来，克服它。你可以把自己掸掉，这是一种说你积极思考让自己感觉更好的方式 —— 想象一下摔倒在地上，当你站起来时，你可能会沾满灰尘和污垢，你需要把自己掸掉灰尘，让自己再次做好准备，然后再继续。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>In the online world though, you don’t have that time. Online dating apps can lead to many rejections and psychologically that can be difficult to manage. Another way of saying ‘difficult to manage’ is difficult to cope with.<br>然而，在网络世界中，你没有那个时间。在线约会应用程序可能会导致许多拒绝，并且在心理上可能难以管理。“难以管理”的另一种说法是难以应对。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Well, we don’t want you to reject us, so time now to give you the answer to that quiz question before a recap of today’s vocabulary. I asked: in the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five.<br>好吧，我们不希望您拒绝我们，所以现在是时候在回顾今天的词汇之前为您提供该测验问题的答案了。我问：在英国，大约有多少婚姻是从这对夫妇在网上见面开始的？是：a） 三分之一；b） 四分之一 c） 五分之一。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Hmmm, so I said b) one in four – 25%. Was I right?<br>嗯，所以我说 b） 四分之一 – 25%。我是对的吗？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Sorry, Rob, the answer is a), one in three. Does that surprise you?<br>对不起，罗伯，答案是 a），三分之一。这让你感到惊讶吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, it does, I didn’t think it would be that high.<br>是的，确实如此，我没想到会那么高。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>It’s the sign of the times, Rob. Digital world – digital dating! Let’s have a look at that vocabulary.<br>这是时代的标志，罗伯。数字世界 – 数字约会！让我们来看看这个词汇。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>OK, well, we started with the verb to swipe. The movement of our finger on smartphone or tablet screen to indicate whether we like someone or not. Swipe right for like, swipe left if you don’t like.<br>好了，我们从动词 to swipe 开始。我们的手指在智能手机或平板电脑屏幕上的移动，以表明我们是否喜欢某人。向右滑动表示喜欢，不喜欢则向左滑动。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Our decisions on whether we find someone attractive or not are often instantaneous. This adjective means immediate, at once.<br>我们决定是否发现某人有吸引力通常是即时的。这个形容词的意思是立即的。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Rejection is when you let someone know that you are not interested in them, you don’t want to be romantically involved with them.<br>拒绝是指你让某人知道你对他们不感兴趣，你不想和他们发生浪漫关系。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>If you are rejected you might need some time to feel better, and for this you can use the phrasal verb get over. It can take some time to get over a rejection.<br>如果你被拒绝了，你可能需要一些时间来感觉好些，为此你可以使用短语动词 get over。克服拒绝可能需要一些时间。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yeah, I know! Being positive and optimistic after a rejection can be described as dusting yourself off.

I’m Catherine.</p><p>Dan<br>And I’m Dan.</p><p>Catherine<br>Now Dan, would you say you had a sedentary lifestyle at all?</p><p>Dan<br>If I only went to work, yes, I would have a pretty sedentary life. I sit on the tube, I sit at my desk or in the studio for most of the day. But because I know that’s not good for my health, I do also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week and I’ll do some exercise, like a bike ride or playing football at the weekend. So, my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life.</p><p>Catherine<br>Nice answer, Dan. And our topic today is about how one country in particular has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population. But before we find out more, here is today’s question. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? So, Dan, what do you think?</p><p>Dan<br>Based on my day, it would be between 8 and 9 hours, but I don’t know if I am an average person! So I’m interested to learn the answer for myself.</p><p>Catherine<br>We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, 40 years ago Finland was perhaps the unhealthiest country in the Western world. But now, it’s one of the healthiest.</p><p>Dan<br>Death by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80% and life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until, has risen by 10 years.</p><p>Catherine<br>How has this been achieved? This was investigated on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and one of the ways Finland has improved the health of the nation is by a lot of state involvement. BBC reporter John Laurenson describes in a humorous way how this works. How does he describe someone with many health problems?</p><p>John Laurenson<br>If you’re an exercise shirker because you’re fat or old or asthmatic or chained to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps, of a stern lady with a clipboard and make some firm suggestions. They won’t actually drag you off your PlayStation, out of your nursing home or out of the pub but they do get quite close.</p><p>Catherine<br>How did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan?</p><p>Dan<br>Well, he wasn’t very complimentary, and we should emphasise that this report is quite tongue-in-cheek, which means that it’s meant to be funny and shouldn’t be taken seriously but he called the people with many health problems ‘super-health disaster zones’.</p><p>Catherine<br>‘Super-health disaster zones’. So what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said?</p><p>Dan<br>He talked about being an exercise shirker. A shirker is someone who avoids doing something usually because they are being lazy. It’s also a verb, to shirk.</p><p>Catherine<br>Laurenson says that if you are an exercise shirker or indeed a super-health disaster zone, someone from the authorities will come and visit you. In another tongue-in-cheek description he says that this visitor might be a stern lady with a clipboard.</p><p>Dan<br>Stern is an adjective which means very serious and strict, someone without a sense of humour who might be quite angry. And in his description the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard. It’s a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you are moving around.</p><p>Catherine<br>So we have this image of an angry lady arriving at your house to tell you off for your health habits and make you live a healthier life.</p><p>Dan<br>But he does point out that they won’t actually drag you out of your house to do exercise. However, in the report he goes on to say that there is lot of encouragement, even from school age, to eat well and take regular exercise.</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, before a stern lady with a clipboard comes and tells us off for not finishing on time, let’s get the answer to today’s quiz. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours?</p><p>Dan<br>And I said I had no idea.</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, the answer was c), Dan - between 8 and 9 hours. In fact, it was 8 and a quarter hours. By comparison, in Finland, it’s less than 6 hours.</p><p>Dan<br>I guess we are a lot more sedentary in Britain.</p><p>Catherine<br>And sedentary is our first word in our vocabulary review. It’s an adjective used to describe a lifestyle which involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise.</p><p>Dan<br>And if you are very sedentary, it can lead to a lower life expectancy. Life expectancy, the age to which you are expected to live.</p><p>Catherine<br>Next we had the word shirker for someone who avoids doing something they don’t like, usually because they are lazy. For example, an exercise shirker avoids exercise.</p><p>Dan<br>Something that is said tongue-in-cheek is meant to be humorous and not taken seriously.</p><p>Catherine<br>If you are stern though, you want to be taken seriously. It’s an adjective that means serious and strict.</p><p>Dan<br>And finally there’s clipboard. A board you attach papers to so you write on them as you walk around.</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, Dan, it’s time for us to go and get some exercise. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, bye.</p><p>Dan<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Catherine.<br>您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Catherine。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>And I’m Dan.<br>我是 Dan。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Now Dan, would you say you had a sedentary lifestyle at all?<br>现在 Dan，你会说你有久坐不动的生活方式吗？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>If I only went to work, yes, I would have a pretty sedentary life. I sit on the tube, I sit at my desk or in the studio for most of the day. But because I know that’s not good for my health, I do also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week and I’ll do some exercise, like a bike ride or playing football at the weekend. So, my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life.<br>如果我只去工作，是的，我会过上久坐不动的生活。我坐在管子上，一天中的大部分时间都坐在我的办公桌前或工作室里。但因为我知道这对我的健康不利，所以我也喜欢每周去几次健身房，我会做一些运动，比如骑自行车或在周末踢足球。所以，我的工作是久坐不动的，但不是我的生活。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Nice answer, Dan. And our topic today is about how one country in particular has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population. But before we find out more, here is today’s question. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? So, Dan, what do you think?<br>“回答得不错，丹。我们今天的主题是关于一个国家如何在处理久坐不动的人口问题方面非常成功。但在我们了解更多信息之前，这里有一个今天的问题。根据最近的一项调查，英国人平均每天坐下多长时间？是：a） 6 到 7 小时之间；b） 7 到 8 小时之间或 c） 8 到 9 小时之间？那么，Dan，你怎么看？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Based on my day, it would be between 8 and 9 hours, but I don’t know if I am an average person! So I’m interested to learn the answer for myself.<br>根据我的一天，这将在 8 到 9 小时之间，但我不知道我是否是一个普通人！所以我很想自己了解答案。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, 40 years ago Finland was perhaps the unhealthiest country in the Western world. But now, it’s one of the healthiest.<br>我们稍后会在节目中找到答案。现在，40 年前，芬兰可能是西方世界最不健康的国家。但现在，它是最健康的疫苗之一。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Death by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80% and life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until, has risen by 10 years.<br>芬兰的心脏病死亡率下降了 80%，预期寿命延长了 10 年。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>How has this been achieved? This was investigated on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and one of the ways Finland has improved the health of the nation is by a lot of state involvement. BBC reporter John Laurenson describes in a humorous way how this works. How does he describe someone with many health problems?<br>这是如何实现的？BBC Radio 4 的 You and Yours 节目对此进行了调查，芬兰改善国家健康的方式之一是通过大量的国家参与。BBC 记者约翰·劳伦森 以幽默的方式描述了这是如何运作的。他如何描述一个有很多健康问题的人？</p><p>John Laurenson(约翰·劳伦森)<br>If you’re an exercise shirker because you’re fat or old or asthmatic or chained to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps, of a stern lady with a clipboard and make some firm suggestions. They won’t actually drag you off your PlayStation, out of your nursing home or out of the pub but they do get quite close.<br>如果你因为肥胖、年老、哮喘、被锁在电脑前、或者只是懒惰或所有这些事情都归入一个超级健康重灾区而成为运动推卸者，他们可能会以一位拿着写字板的严厉女士的形式来找你，并提出一些坚定的建议。他们实际上不会把你从 PlayStation 上拖下来，拖出你的疗养院或酒吧，但他们确实非常接近。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>How did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan?<br>丹，他是如何描述一个有很多健康问题的人的？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Well, he wasn’t very complimentary, and we should emphasise that this report is quite tongue-in-cheek, which means that it’s meant to be funny and shouldn’t be taken seriously but he called the people with many health problems ‘super-health disaster zones’.<br>嗯，他不是很恭维，我们应该强调，这份报告相当半开玩笑，这意味着它本来就是为了搞笑，不应该被认真对待，但他称有很多健康问题的人为“超级健康灾难区”。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>‘Super-health disaster zones’. So what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said?<br>“超级健康灾区”。那么，我们还可以从他所说的内容中挑选出哪些其他词汇呢？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>He talked about being an exercise shirker. A shirker is someone who avoids doing something usually because they are being lazy. It’s also a verb, to shirk.<br>他谈到自己是一个运动推销者。推卸责任的人通常是因为他们懒惰而避免做某事。它也是一个动词，即 shrk。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Laurenson says that if you are an exercise shirker or indeed a super-health disaster zone, someone from the authorities will come and visit you. In another tongue-in-cheek description he says that this visitor might be a stern lady with a clipboard.<br>劳伦森说，如果你是一个运动推销者，或者确实是一个超级健康重灾区，当局会有人来拜访你。在另一个半开玩笑的描述中，他说这位访客可能是一位拿着写字板的严厉女士。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Stern is an adjective which means very serious and strict, someone without a sense of humour who might be quite angry. And in his description the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard. It’s a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you are moving around.<br>Stern 是一个形容词，意思是非常严肃和严格，一个没有幽默感的人可能会很生气。在他的描述中，记者说这位严厉的女士将有一个剪贴板。这是一块硬板，您可以在上面贴上纸张，这样您就可以在四处走动时在纸上写字。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>So we have this image of an angry lady arriving at your house to tell you off for your health habits and make you live a healthier life.<br>所以我们有一张生气的女士来到你家的照片，告诉你的健康习惯，让你过上更健康的生活。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>But he does point out that they won’t actually drag you out of your house to do exercise. However, in the report he goes on to say that there is lot of encouragement, even from school age, to eat well and take regular exercise.<br>但他确实指出，他们实际上不会把你拖出家门去锻炼。然而，在报告中，他继续说，即使从学生时代开始，也有很多鼓励要吃得好并定期锻炼。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, before a stern lady with a clipboard comes and tells us off for not finishing on time, let’s get the answer to today’s quiz. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours?<br>好吧，在一位拿着写字板的严厉女士来告诉我们没有按时完成之前，让我们来了解今天测验的答案。根据最近的一项调查，英国人平均每天坐下多长时间？是：a） 6 到 7 小时之间；b） 7 到 8 小时之间或 c） 8 到 9 小时之间？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>And I said I had no idea.<br>我说我不知道。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, the answer was c), Dan - between 8 and 9 hours. In fact, it was 8 and a quarter hours. By comparison, in Finland, it’s less than 6 hours.<br>嗯，答案是 c）， Dan - 8 到 9 小时之间。事实上，那是 8 个半小时。相比之下，芬兰的车程不到 6 小时。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>I guess we are a lot more sedentary in Britain.<br>我想我们在英国久坐不动的情况要多得多。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And sedentary is our first word in our vocabulary review. It’s an adjective used to describe a lifestyle which involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise.<br>久坐是我们词汇复习中的第一个词。这是一个形容词，用于描述一种涉及大量坐着而不进行太多运动的生活方式。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>And if you are very sedentary, it can lead to a lower life expectancy. Life expectancy, the age to which you are expected to live.<br>如果你久坐不动，可能会导致预期寿命降低。预期寿命，您预计的寿命。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Next we had the word shirker for someone who avoids doing something they don’t like, usually because they are lazy. For example, an exercise shirker avoids exercise.<br>接下来，我们有 shirker 这个词，指的是那些避免做他们不喜欢的事情的人，通常是因为他们很懒惰。例如，运动的 shirker 避免运动。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Something that is said tongue-in-cheek is meant to be humorous and not taken seriously.<br>半开玩笑地说的话是为了幽默而不是被认真对待。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>If you are stern though, you want to be taken seriously. It’s an adjective that means serious and strict.<br>不过，如果你很严厉，你就会希望被认真对待。这是一个形容词，意思是严肃和严格。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>And finally there’s clipboard. A board you attach papers to so you write on them as you walk around.<br>最后是剪贴板。一块你把文件贴在上面的板子，这样你就可以在走动时在上面写字。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, Dan, it’s time for us to go and get some exercise.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>Now Rob, you like your food, don’t you?</p><p>Rob<br>Oh yes, yum yum, food! One of my favourite things.</p><p>Neil<br>And what do you think of street food?</p><p>Rob<br>I love street food. There are some great places in London where you can find delicious foods from all over the world, cooked in front of you in market stalls on the street.</p><p>Neil<br>It’s quite new though, isn’t it - not really a British tradition.</p><p>Rob<br>I guess not, but it seems to be much more popular these days.</p><p>Neil<br>Well our topic today is street food, but before we tuck into that, here is today’s question. Recently archaeologists in Jordan discovered what they believe is the oldest remains of bread. How old is this bread? Is it… a) 18,000 years old; b) 14,000 years old, or c) 5,500 years old? What do you think?</p><p>Rob<br>I don’t know - but what I do know is, I wouldn’t really want to try a sandwich made from that bread!</p><p>Neil<br>Mmm, it might be a bit mouldy.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes! Anyway, I’m going to have a guess and say c) 5,500 years old.</p><p>Neil<br>Right, we will find out the answer later in the programme. Mark Laurie is from the Nationwide Caterers Association. He is an expert in the business of street food in the UK. He appeared on BBC radio’s The Food Programme and was asked how the business of street food has changed in recent years. In his answer he talks about the areas where there is most growth in street food. What are those areas?</p><p>Mark Laurie<br>It’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like.</p><p>Neil<br>So where does he say the popularity of street food is growing?</p><p>Rob<br>He says that it’s in the bigger cities and also in the provinces. The provinces is a word which means the parts of a country outside of the cities.</p><p>Neil<br>So essentially, he’s saying it’s getting more popular everywhere.</p><p>Rob<br>Exactly. In fact he says the growth is phenomenal. This means he thinks the growth is spectacular, really big.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes he says that it’s really taken off. Taken off is one of those phrasal verbs that can be used in many different ways. In this sense, when something takes off it means it becomes successful and popular.</p><p>Rob<br>You know, street food isn’t really something you associate with Britain. Perhaps it’s the climate or British food - so street food is something that we are now getting used to and enjoying more. In fact Mark says that it’s now becoming mainstream. This means that is no longer something that it’s seen as being unusual or different. It’s becoming an accepted part of the everyday eating experience.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, let’s listen again to Mark Laurie talking about the growth of street food in the UK.</p><p>Mark Laurie<br>It’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like.</p><p>Neil<br>Mark Laurie goes on to talk about why street food has become popular. What kind of food does he say it’s not like?</p><p>Mark Laurie<br>Yeah, it’s just really captured the imagination of the public. It’s honest food, it’s authentic food and it’s people that you can trust making it. It’s not some microwave food or whatever that you might get in your local pub.</p><p>Neil<br>So street food is many things, but what isn’t it?</p><p>Rob<br>Well he says that it’s not like food you might get in some pubs. That food, he says, may be some microwave food. Which is food prepared in a microwave oven.</p><p>Neil<br>You know I quite like a microwave meal now and then and I reheat my leftovers in the microwave.</p><p>Rob<br>But I guess if you were paying for a nice meal you wouldn’t expect reheated leftovers! I think the point he is making is that in many places the food you are served is not freshly made. It may be pre-prepared and finished off in a microwave. Street food, he says, is authentic.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, authentic. It’s real, fresh and cooked right in front of you and if it’s food from a particular country it’s probably being prepared by people from that culture.</p><p>Rob<br>He also says that this has captured the imagination of the public. It’s something that the public have experienced and thought - ‘Yep, you know, I like this, this is a great idea.’.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, all this talk of food is making me hungry, so let’s get the answer to the quiz and review today’s vocabulary before we head off and grab a bite to eat. We asked about the age of bread discovered by archaeologists in Jordan. Was it a) 18,000 years old, b) 14,000 years or c) 5,500 years?</p><p>Rob<br>Mmm, and I said it was c) 5,500 years.</p><p>Neil<br>And I’m afraid it’s a lot mouldier than that. The answer was 14,000 years.</p><p>Rob<br>Very tasty I’m sure.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes! Right then, the vocabulary. We started off with the adjective phenomenal to describe something that is amazing, remarkable and extraordinary.</p><p>Rob<br>Then we had to take off, a phrasal verb which means to become popular. Street food has really taken off in the UK: it’s become really popular.</p><p>Neil<br>And not just in the cities but also in the provinces, which is a noun to describe areas of a country that aren’t the major cities.</p><p>Rob<br>Something which captures the imagination is something which makes you interested and not just for a short time.</p><p>Neil<br>And one thing which has captured the imagination of the British public is authentic street food. Something authentic is real, it’s genuine, it’s not a fake or a copy.</p><p>Rob<br>And finally we had microwave food, food prepared in a microwave oven. And that kind of food is not seen by some as authentic.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, it’s time to eat, so that’s all we have time for today. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, bye.</p><p>Rob<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.<br>你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I’m Rob.<br>我是 罗伯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now Rob, you like your food, don’t you?<br>现在 罗伯，你喜欢你的食物，不是吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Oh yes, yum yum, food! One of my favourite things.<br>哦，对了，好吃，美食！我最喜欢的事情之一。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And what do you think of street food?<br>你觉得街头小吃怎么样？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I love street food. There are some great places in London where you can find delicious foods from all over the world, cooked in front of you in market stalls on the street.<br>我喜欢街头小吃。伦敦有一些很棒的地方，你可以在那里找到来自世界各地的美味佳肴，这些食物在街上的市场摊位上烹制而成。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>It’s quite new though, isn’t it - not really a British tradition.<br>不过，这很新，不是吗 - 并不是真正的英国传统。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I guess not, but it seems to be much more popular these days.<br>我猜不是，但最近它似乎更受欢迎了。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well our topic today is street food, but before we tuck into that, here is today’s question. Recently archaeologists in Jordan discovered what they believe is the oldest remains of bread. How old is this bread? Is it… a) 18,000 years old; b) 14,000 years old, or c) 5,500 years old? What do you think?<br>我们今天的主题是街头小吃，但在我们深入讨论之前，这里是今天的问题。最近，约旦的考古学家发现了他们认为是最古老的面包遗骸。这面包有多少年了？是吗。。。a） 18,000 年；b） 14,000 年，还是 c） 5,500 年？你觉得怎么样？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I don’t know - but what I do know is, I wouldn’t really want to try a sandwich made from that bread!<br>我不知道 - 但我所知道的是，我真的不想尝试用这种面包做的三明治！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Mmm, it might be a bit mouldy.<br>嗯，它可能有点发霉。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes! Anyway, I’m going to have a guess and say c) 5,500 years old.<br>是的！无论如何，我要猜一下，然后说 c） 5,500 岁。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Right, we will find out the answer later in the programme. Mark Laurie is from the Nationwide Caterers Association. He is an expert in the business of street food in the UK. He appeared on BBC radio’s The Food Programme and was asked how the business of street food has changed in recent years. In his answer he talks about the areas where there is most growth in street food. What are those areas?<br>好的，我们将在稍后的节目中找到答案。Mark Laurie 来自全国餐饮业协会。他是英国街头食品业务的专家。他出现在 BBC 电台的 The Food Programme 上，并被问及近年来街头食品业务发生了怎样的变化。在他的回答中，他谈到了街头食品增长最快的地区。这些区域是什么？</p><p>Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)<br>It’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like.<br>街头食品的增长非常惊人，它真的起飞了，它真的成为了相当主流。这个国家文化结构的一部分，真的，或者说它开始成为，肯定是在大城市，而且如果你愿意的话，越来越多地出现在那种省份。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So where does he say the popularity of street food is growing?<br>那么，他认为街头食品的受欢迎程度在哪里增长呢？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>He says that it’s in the bigger cities and also in the provinces. The provinces is a word which means the parts of a country outside of the cities.<br>他说，在大城市和外省都有。省是一个词，意思是城市以外的国家部分。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So essentially, he’s saying it’s getting more popular everywhere.<br>所以从本质上讲，他是在说它在任何地方都越来越受欢迎。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Exactly. In fact he says the growth is phenomenal. This means he thinks the growth is spectacular, really big.<br>完全。事实上，他说增长是惊人的。这意味着他认为增长非常壮观，非常大。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes he says that it’s really taken off. Taken off is one of those phrasal verbs that can be used in many different ways. In this sense, when something takes off it means it becomes successful and popular.<br>是的，他说它真的起飞了。Taken off 是可以以多种不同方式使用的短语动词之一。从这个意义上说，当某件事起飞时，意味着它变得成功和受欢迎。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>You know, street food isn’t really something you associate with Britain. Perhaps it’s the climate or British food - so street food is something that we are now getting used to and enjoying more. In fact Mark says that it’s now becoming mainstream. This means that is no longer something that it’s seen as being unusual or different. It’s becoming an accepted part of the everyday eating experience.<br>你知道，街头小吃并不是你真正与英国联系在一起的东西。也许是气候或英国食物 - 所以街头小吃是我们现在已经习惯并更加享受的东西。事实上，Mark 说它现在正在成为主流。这意味着它不再被视为不寻常或不同的东西。它正在成为日常饮食体验中被接受的一部分。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, let’s listen again to Mark Laurie talking about the growth of street food in the UK.<br>好吧，让我们再听听 Mark Laurie 谈论英国街头食品的增长。</p><p>Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)<br>It’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like.<br>街头食品的增长非常惊人，它真的起飞了，它真的成为了相当主流。这个国家文化结构的一部分，真的，或者说它开始成为，肯定是在大城市，而且如果你愿意的话，越来越多地出现在那种省份。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Mark Laurie goes on to talk about why street food has become popular. What kind of food does he say it’s not like?<br>Mark Laurie 继续谈论街头食品变得流行的原因。他说这不像什么样的食物？</p><p>Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)<br>Yeah, it’s just really captured the imagination of the public. It’s honest food, it’s authentic food and it’s people that you can trust making it. It’s not some microwave food or whatever that you might get in your local pub.<br>是的，它真的抓住了公众的想象力。这是诚实的食物，是正宗的食物，而且是您可以信任的人制作。它不是一些微波炉食物或任何你在当地酒吧可能买到的东西。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So street food is many things, but what isn’t it?<br>所以街头小吃有很多东西，但什么不是呢？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well he says that it’s not like food you might get in some pubs. That food, he says, may be some microwave food. Which is food prepared in a microwave oven.<br>嗯，他说这不像你在一些酒吧里买到的食物。他说，那种食物可能是一些微波炉食物。这是在微波炉中准备的食物。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You know I quite like a microwave meal now and then and I reheat my leftovers in the microwave.<br>你知道我很喜欢时不时地用微波炉加热我的剩菜。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>But I guess if you were paying for a nice meal you wouldn’t expect reheated leftovers! I think the point he is making is that in many places the food you are served is not freshly made. It may be pre-prepared and finished off in a microwave. Street food, he says, is authentic.<br>但我想，如果你花钱吃一顿美餐，你就不会指望重新加热的剩菜了！我认为他想说的是，在许多地方，你吃到的食物不是新鲜制作的。它可以预先准备好并在微波炉中完成。他说，街头小吃是正宗的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, authentic. It’s real, fresh and cooked right in front of you and if it’s food from a particular country it’s probably being prepared by people from that culture.<br>是的，正宗的。它是真实的、新鲜的，就在你面前烹制的，如果它是来自特定国家的食物，它可能是由来自该文化的人准备的。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>He also says that this has captured the imagination of the public. It’s something that the public have experienced and thought - ‘Yep, you know, I like this, this is a great idea.’.<br>他还表示，这激发了公众的想象力。这是公众经历过并认为的事情 - ‘是的，你知道，我喜欢这个，这是一个好主意。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, all this talk of food is making me hungry, so let’s get the answer to the quiz and review today’s vocabulary before we head off and grab a bite to eat. We asked about the age of bread discovered by archaeologists in Jordan. Was it a) 18,000 years old, b) 14,000 years or c) 5,500 years?<br>好吧，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我感到饥饿，所以让我们得到测验的答案，并在我们出发吃点东西之前复习今天的词汇。我们询问了约旦考古学家发现的面包的年代。是 a） 18,000 年，b） 14,000 年还是 c） 5,500 年？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Mmm, and I said it was c) 5,500 years.<br>嗯，我说是 c） 5,500 年。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And I’m afraid it’s a lot mouldier than that. The answer was 14,000 years.<br>而且我担心它比这要霉得多。答案是 14,000 年。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Very tasty I’m sure.<br>我敢肯定，非常好吃。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes! Right then, the vocabulary. We started off with the adjective phenomenal to describe something that is amazing, remarkable and extraordinary.<br>是的！就在那时，词汇。我们从形容词 phenomenal 开始来描述令人惊叹、非凡和非凡的事情。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Then we had to take off, a phrasal verb which means to become popular. Street food has really taken off in the UK: it’s become really popular.<br>然后我们不得不起飞，一个短语动词，意思是变得流行。街头小吃在英国真正起飞：它变得非常受欢迎。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And not just in the cities but also in the provinces, which is a noun to describe areas of a country that aren’t the major cities.<br>不仅在城市，而且在省份，这是一个名词，用来描述一个国家不是主要城市的地区。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Something which captures the imagination is something which makes you interested and not just for a short time.<br>吸引想象力的东西是让你感兴趣的东西，而不仅仅是短暂的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And one thing which has captured the imagination of the British public is authentic street food. Something authentic is real, it’s genuine, it’s not a fake or a copy.<br>吸引英国公众想象力的一件事是正宗的街头食品。真实的东西就是真的，它是真实的，不是假的或复制的。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And finally we had microwave food, food prepared in a microwave oven.

I’m Neil.</p><p>Catherine<br>And I’m Catherine. Hello!</p><p>Neil<br>Now, Catherine, say cheese.</p><p>Catherine<br>Cheeeese.</p><p>Neil<br>Thank you, a little souvenir of our time together.</p><p>Catherine<br>Let’s have a look… Hang on a minute. You just took a selfie, I wasn’t even in the picture.</p><p>Neil<br>Ah, well, that’s the magic of the smartphone, two cameras! You know, that’s not something you can do with a traditional camera. I mean, do you even have a separate camera these days?</p><p>Catherine<br>I do actually. It’s in a cupboard somewhere at home.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, that is the topic of this programme. Have traditional cameras been completely replaced by smartphones, or to put it another way, have cameras been made obsolete by the smartphone?</p><p>Catherine<br>Interesting question. But before we get into this topic, how about a question for our listeners?</p><p>Neil<br>Of course. We are certainly in the digital age of photography but when was the first digital camera phone released? Was it: a) 2000; b) 2004 or c) 2007? What do you think?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, I actually know this one, so I’m going to be fair and keep it to myself.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme. There are different kinds of cameras available today. There are compact cameras, which are small and mostly automatic and usually come with a fixed lens.</p><p>Catherine<br>That’s right. And then there are SLRs and DSLRs which are bigger, and you can change the lenses on these cameras and they allow for a lot of manual control.</p><p>Neil<br>And there are also mirrorless cameras, which are a cross between compact cameras and DSLRs. They are small like a compact camera but you can also use the same lenses on them that you can use on DSLRs.</p><p>Catherine<br>And of course, there are the cameras on smartphones, and these are convenient and they’re becoming increasingly sophisticated.</p><p>Neil<br>Phil Hall is the editor of Tech Radar magazine. He was asked on the BBC programme You and Yours if he thought smartphones would make other cameras obsolete. What is his opinion?</p><p>Phil Hall<br>I don’t think so. I think while compact camera sales have really sort of dropped off a cliff, it’s the lower end, cheap compacts where people have opted for a smartphone and I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras, high-end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to, mirrorless cameras. So, the market’s changing. And I don’t think there’ll be a time soon, yet, that… the smartphone will take over the camera completely.</p><p>Neil<br>So does Phil think smartphones will kill the camera?</p><p>Catherine<br>In a word, no. He does say that sales of cheap compact cameras have dropped off a cliff. This rather dramatic expression describes a very big fall in sales.</p><p>Neil<br>This is because the kind of consumers who would choose a compact camera are now opting for the camera on their smartphone. When you opt for something you choose it rather than something else.</p><p>Catherine<br>For people who want a quick, easy to use and convenient way to take reasonable quality photos, compact cameras used to be the best choice – but now it’s the smartphone.</p><p>Neil<br>So camera makers are now moving to the more high-end market, the DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. So who is still buying these more expensive cameras? Here’s Phil Hall again.</p><p>Phil Hall<br>I think it’s… some of it is people who are picking up a smartphone and sort of getting into photography that way and that’s a really great first step into photography and I think people are probably, sometimes, getting a bit frustrated with the quality once they sort of start pushing their creative skills and then looking to see what’s the next rung up so it’s people wanting to broaden their creative skills a bit.</p><p>Neil<br>Who does he say might be buying cameras?</p><p>Catherine<br>He says that people who are getting into photography might get frustrated with the quality of smartphones.</p><p>Neil<br>Getting into something means becoming very interested in it.</p><p>Catherine<br>And if you are frustrated with something it means you are disappointed with it. You are not happy with it.</p><p>Neil<br>So people who have got into photography with a smartphone but are frustrated with its limitations and want to be more creative are going to the next level. They are moving up, they are, as Phil said taking ‘the next rung up’.</p><p>Catherine<br>Now, a rung is the horizontal step of a ladder, so the expression taking the next rung up is a way to describe doing something at a higher level.</p><p>Neil<br>Now, talking of higher levels, did you get this week’s quiz question right? The question was: When was the first phone with a digital camera released? Was it 2000, 2004 or 2007? The first phone with a digital camera was released in 2000. Now, to take us up to the end of the programme, let’s look at the vocabulary again.</p><p>Catherine<br>First we had the adjective obsolete which describes something that has been replaced and is no longer the first choice.</p><p>Neil<br>When the expression to drop off a cliff is used about, for example, sales numbers, it means sales have fallen significantly over a short period of time.</p><p>Catherine<br>To opt for something means to choose something and when you become very interested in an activity you can say that you get into it.</p><p>Neil<br>If you are trying to do something and you can’t do it because you don’t have the skill or the equipment you are using is not right or not good enough, you can become frustrated.</p><p>Catherine<br>And developing your skills to a higher level can be described as taking the next rung up.</p><p>Neil<br>Right, that’s all from us from us in this programme. Do join us again next time and don’t forget that in the meantime you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon. Goodbye.</p><p>Catherine<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Neil.<br>您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Neil。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And I’m Catherine. Hello!<br>我是 Catherine。你好！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now, Catherine, say cheese.<br>现在，凯瑟琳，说奶酪。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Cheeeese.<br>Cheeeese 的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Thank you, a little souvenir of our time together.<br>谢谢你，我们在一起的时光的小纪念品。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Let’s have a look… Hang on a minute. You just took a selfie, I wasn’t even in the picture.<br>让我们来看看……等一下。你只是拍了一张自拍，我甚至不在照片里。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Ah, well, that’s the magic of the smartphone, two cameras! You know, that’s not something you can do with a traditional camera. I mean, do you even have a separate camera these days?<br>啊，嗯，这就是智能手机的魔力，两个摄像头！你知道，这不是传统相机可以做到的。我的意思是，你现在有单独的相机吗？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>I do actually. It’s in a cupboard somewhere at home.<br>我实际上是这样做的。它在家里某个地方的橱柜里。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, that is the topic of this programme. Have traditional cameras been completely replaced by smartphones, or to put it another way, have cameras been made obsolete by the smartphone?<br>嗯，这就是这个节目的主题。传统相机是否已完全被智能手机取代，或者换句话说，智能手机是否已经过时了？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Interesting question. But before we get into this topic, how about a question for our listeners?<br>有趣的问题。但在我们进入这个话题之前，我们先向听众提出一个问题吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Of course. We are certainly in the digital age of photography but when was the first digital camera phone released? Was it: a) 2000; b) 2004 or c) 2007? What do you think?<br>答案是肯定的。我们当然处于摄影的数字时代，但第一款数码照相手机是什么时候发布的呢？是：a） 2000 年；b） 2004 年还是 c） 2007 年？你觉得怎么样？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, I actually know this one, so I’m going to be fair and keep it to myself.<br>嗯，我其实知道这个，所以我要公平地说，把它留给自己。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme. There are different kinds of cameras available today. There are compact cameras, which are small and mostly automatic and usually come with a fixed lens.<br>好，好吧，请听节目结束时的答案。今天有不同种类的相机可用。有紧凑型相机，它们很小，大部分是自动的，通常带有固定镜头。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>That’s right. And then there are SLRs and DSLRs which are bigger, and you can change the lenses on these cameras and they allow for a lot of manual control.<br>没错。然后是更大的 SLR 和 DSLR，您可以更换这些相机的镜头，它们允许进行大量手动控制。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And there are also mirrorless cameras, which are a cross between compact cameras and DSLRs. They are small like a compact camera but you can also use the same lenses on them that you can use on DSLRs.<br>还有无反光镜相机，它是紧凑型相机和数码单反相机的交叉。它们像紧凑型相机一样小，但您也可以在它们上使用与数码单反相机相同的镜头。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And of course, there are the cameras on smartphones, and these are convenient and they’re becoming increasingly sophisticated.<br>当然，智能手机上也有摄像头，这些摄像头很方便，而且它们变得越来越复杂。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Phil Hall is the editor of Tech Radar magazine. He was asked on the BBC programme You and Yours if he thought smartphones would make other cameras obsolete. What is his opinion?<br>Phil Hall 是 Tech Radar 杂志的编辑。在 BBC 节目 You and Yours 中，有人问他是否认为智能手机会让其他相机过时。他怎么看呢？</p><p>Phil Hall(菲尔·霍尔)<br>I don’t think so. I think while compact camera sales have really sort of dropped off a cliff, it’s the lower end, cheap compacts where people have opted for a smartphone and I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras, high-end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to, mirrorless cameras. So, the market’s changing. And I don’t think there’ll be a time soon, yet, that… the smartphone will take over the camera completely.<br>我不这么认为。我认为，虽然紧凑型相机的销量确实有所下降，但人们选择了智能手机，而低端、廉价的紧凑型相机则选择了智能手机，我认为制造商正在关注更高端的高端相机、高端紧凑型相机、数码单反相机，这些相机是可以安装镜头的相机，无反光镜相机。所以，市场正在发生变化。而且我认为不会很快出现……智能手机将完全接管相机。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So does Phil think smartphones will kill the camera?<br>那么 Phil 认为智能手机会杀死相机吗？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>In a word, no. He does say that sales of cheap compact cameras have dropped off a cliff. This rather dramatic expression describes a very big fall in sales.<br>一句话，没有。他确实说过，廉价紧凑型相机的销量已经急剧下降。这个相当戏剧性的表达描述了销售额的大幅下降。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>This is because the kind of consumers who would choose a compact camera are now opting for the camera on their smartphone. When you opt for something you choose it rather than something else.<br>这是因为选择紧凑型相机的那种消费者现在正在选择智能手机上的相机。当你选择某样东西时，你自己选择了它，而不是其他东西。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>For people who want a quick, easy to use and convenient way to take reasonable quality photos, compact cameras used to be the best choice – but now it’s the smartphone.<br>对于想要以快速、易于使用和方便的方式拍摄质量合理的照片的人来说，紧凑型相机曾经是最佳选择 —— 但现在它是智能手机。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So camera makers are now moving to the more high-end market, the DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. So who is still buying these more expensive cameras? Here’s Phil Hall again.<br>因此，相机制造商现在正在转向更高端的市场，即 DSLR 和无反光镜相机。那么谁还在购买这些更昂贵的相机呢？又是 Phil Hall。</p><p>Phil Hall(菲尔·霍尔)<br>I think it’s… some of it is people who are picking up a smartphone and sort of getting into photography that way and that’s a really great first step into photography and I think people are probably, sometimes, getting a bit frustrated with the quality once they sort of start pushing their creative skills and then looking to see what’s the next rung up so it’s people wanting to broaden their creative skills a bit.<br>我认为这是……其中一些人拿起智能手机，以这种方式进入摄影领域，这是进入摄影界的非常好的第一步，我认为人们有时可能会对质量感到有点沮丧，一旦他们开始提高自己的创意技能，然后看看下一步会发生什么，所以人们想要拓宽他们的创意技能。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Who does he say might be buying cameras?<br>他说谁可能会购买相机？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>He says that people who are getting into photography might get frustrated with the quality of smartphones.<br>他说，从事摄影的人可能会对智能手机的质量感到沮丧。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Getting into something means becoming very interested in it.<br>进入某样东西意味着对它非常感兴趣。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And if you are frustrated with something it means you are disappointed with it. You are not happy with it.<br>如果你对某件事感到沮丧，那就意味着你对它感到失望。你对它不满意。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So people who have got into photography with a smartphone but are frustrated with its limitations and want to be more creative are going to the next level. They are moving up, they are, as Phil said taking ‘the next rung up’.<br>因此，那些使用智能手机开始摄影但对其局限性感到沮丧并希望更具创意的人将更上一层楼。他们正在上升，正如 Phil 所说，他们正在迈出“下一个梯级”。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Now, a rung is the horizontal step of a ladder, so the expression taking the next rung up is a way to describe doing something at a higher level.<br>现在，梯级是梯子的水平台阶，所以 takes the next rung up 这句话是描述在更高层次上做某事的一种方式。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now, talking of higher levels, did you get this week’s quiz question right? The question was: When was the first phone with a digital camera released? Was it 2000, 2004 or 2007? The first phone with a digital camera was released in 2000. Now, to take us up to the end of the programme, let’s look at the vocabulary again.<br>现在，说到更高级别，你对本周的测验问题理解正确吗？问题是：第一款带有数码相机的手机是什么时候发布的？是 2000 年、2004 年还是 2007 年？第一款带有数码相机的手机于 2000 年发布。现在，为了带我们进入节目的结尾，让我们再次看一下词汇。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>First we had the adjective obsolete which describes something that has been replaced and is no longer the first choice.<br>首先，我们有形容词 obsolete，它描述了已被替换且不再是首选的事物。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>When the expression to drop off a cliff is used about, for example, sales numbers, it means sales have fallen significantly over a short period of time.<br>例如，当 drop off a cliff 一词用于销售数字时，表示销售额在短时间内大幅下降。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>To opt for something means to choose something and when you become very interested in an activity you can say that you get into it.<br>To choose for something 意味着选择某事，当你对一项活动非常感兴趣时，你可以说你进入了它。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>If you are trying to do something and you can’t do it because you don’t have the skill or the equipment you are using is not right or not good enough, you can become frustrated.<br>如果你正在尝试做某事但因为你没有技能或你使用的设备不正确或不够好而无法做到，你可能会感到沮丧。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And developing your skills to a higher level can be described as taking the next rung up.<br>将您的技能发展到更高的水平可以被描述为更上一层楼。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Right, that’s all from us from us in this programme.

How did you know? Is it the grey hair in my beard? Is it the wrinkles around the eyes?</p><p>Catherine<br>I thought that was just your age.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, yes, maybe. In today’s programme we’re going to be talking about fathers and how being a father has changed over the years. But before we hear more about this topic, our question for the day. According to recent research in the UK, what percentage of men are present when their children are born? Is it… a) 55%; b) 75% c) 95% What do you think?</p><p>Catherine<br>I think a lot of men these days like to see their children born. It’s not culturally inappropriate so I’m going to go for 95%.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, Dr Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist. She studies, among other things, how human behaviour has changed and is changing. She’s written a book called The Life of Dad. She’s been studying new fathers and spoke about her research on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. She asked why men want to become fathers. She starts by saying that there are lots of reasons but how many does she mention in her answer?</p><p>Dr Anna Machin<br>There’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was.</p><p>Neil<br>How many reasons does she mention?</p><p>Catherine<br>She mentioned three reasons. The first was that it was that time in life – the guys had a home and a job and having children was the thing to do next.</p><p>Neil<br>Another reason was that it was what their partners wanted, even if they weren’t that keen themselves. If you’re not keen on something it means you are ‘not enthusiastic about it’, it’s not really something you want to do, but because it’s what their partner wants they agree to it, or as Dr Machin said, they’re going along with it.</p><p>Catherine<br>Yes, going along with something, is a phrase that means ‘agreeing to do’ something even though you don’t really want to do it. It’s interesting that Dr Machin said that some men admit to this. To admit to something is to say or agree that something is true even if you’re perhaps ashamed of it or you don’t want it to be true.</p><p>Neil<br>There was one more reason she mentioned and that was that some men become parents because they want to be a better father than their own father had been. Let’s listen again.</p><p>Dr Anna Machin<br>There’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was.</p><p>Neil<br>So what is it about some father’s own dads that they didn’t like? Here’s Dr Machin again.</p><p>Dr Anna Machin<br>Well, in some cases, you know, the father would be neglectful, some fathers were absent and others they just felt they were a very, I suppose, we’d say a 1950s father so distant, disciplinarian not actually involved in their children’s daily life and certainly not involved in their care. So today’s generation fathers, even in the 10 years that I’ve been studying dads we’ve seen a massive evolution in how hands-on fathers are.</p><p>Neil<br>She talks there about some negative characteristics associated with dads in the past. She suggests that some fathers didn’t have a very close relationship with their sons, they were absent which means they weren’t at home a lot and ‘didn’t spend time’ with their children.</p><p>Catherine<br>Yes, and some fathers were seen as a disciplinarian. That describes someone whose main communication with their children was to give them strict rules and tell them off or punish them if they did something wrong.</p><p>Neil<br>These days, according to Dr Machin, fathers are much more hands-on. This phrase means they are ‘much more involved’ with their children and share bringing up their children with their partners.</p><p>Catherine<br>And talking of sharing, Neil, come on – it’s time to know the answer to today’s question.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes indeed. According to recent research in the UK, what is the percentage of fathers who are there when their children are born? Was it 55%, 75% or 95%?</p><p>Catherine<br>And I said a very optimistic 95%.</p><p>Neil<br>Being optimistic is good obviously because you are correct.</p><p>Catherine<br>That’s fantastic!</p><p>Neil<br>And now, for something else fantastic, our review of today’s vocabulary…</p><p>Catherine<br>We started off with admit to for when you say something is true, even if it might make you look a little bit bad. And before we go on I have to admit, Neil, that it was me who ate your biscuit.</p><p>Neil<br>Which one?</p><p>Catherine<br>The one that you left on the desk.</p><p>Neil<br>That’s all right. I wasn’t really keen on it anyway. It had been on the floor.</p><p>Catherine<br>What? Yuck!</p><p>Neil<br>Yeah, well, it serves you right! And to be keen on something is our next phrase, meaning ‘being very interested in and enthusiastic about’ something.</p><p>Catherine<br>Then we had to go along with something. This is when you agree to do something even if you are not keen on it.</p><p>Neil<br>An absent father is one who is not at home to spend time with his children.</p><p>Catherine<br>And some fathers are disciplinarians. They have strict rules and they give out punishments but these days more fathers are hands-on which means they are ‘very much involved’ in looking after and bringing up their children.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, that’s all we have time for today. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon.

How did you know? Is it the grey hair in my beard? Is it the wrinkles around the eyes?<br>我当爸爸了。你怎么知道的？是我胡须上的白发吗？是眼睛周围的皱纹吗？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>I thought that was just your age.<br>我以为那只是你的年龄。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, yes, maybe. In today’s programme we’re going to be talking about fathers and how being a father has changed over the years. But before we hear more about this topic, our question for the day. According to recent research in the UK, what percentage of men are present when their children are born? Is it… a) 55%; b) 75% c) 95% What do you think?<br>嗯，是的，也许吧。在今天的节目中，我们将讨论父亲以及这些年来成为父亲的变化。但在我们听到更多关于这个话题的信息之前，我们今天的问题。根据英国最近的研究，当孩子出生时，男性在场的百分比是多少？是吗。。。a） 55%；b） 75% c） 95% 你怎么看？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>I think a lot of men these days like to see their children born. It’s not culturally inappropriate so I’m going to go for 95%.<br>我认为现在很多男人都喜欢看到他们的孩子出生。这在文化上并不合适，所以我会追求 95%。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, Dr Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist. She studies, among other things, how human behaviour has changed and is changing. She’s written a book called The Life of Dad. She’s been studying new fathers and spoke about her research on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. She asked why men want to become fathers. She starts by saying that there are lots of reasons but how many does she mention in her answer?<br>好吧，我们会在节目结束时了解您是否正确。现在，Anna Machin 博士是一位进化人类学家。她研究人类行为如何变化以及正在发生变化。她写了一本书，叫《爸爸的生活》。她一直在研究新爸爸，并在 BBC 的 Woman’s Hour 节目中谈到了她的研究。她问为什么男人想成为父亲。她首先说有很多原因，但她在回答中提到了多少？</p><p>Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)<br>There’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was.<br>男人想当爸爸的原因有很多……对他们中的一些人来说，这只是他们已经到达的人生阶段。他们有房子，有工作，现在是组建家庭的时候了。有时他们承认实际上他们并不那么热衷，但他们的伴侣想要一个孩子，所以他们有点同意。有相当多的人实际上说他们这样做是因为他们想撤销父亲对他们所做的一切，所以改写与父亲和父亲经历有关的历史，成为比他们父亲更好的父亲。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>How many reasons does she mention?<br>她提到了多少个原因？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>She mentioned three reasons. The first was that it was that time in life – the guys had a home and a job and having children was the thing to do next.<br>她提到了三个原因。首先是那是人生中的那个时期 —— 伙计们有家和工作，生孩子是接下来要做的事情。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Another reason was that it was what their partners wanted, even if they weren’t that keen themselves. If you’re not keen on something it means you are ‘not enthusiastic about it’, it’s not really something you want to do, but because it’s what their partner wants they agree to it, or as Dr Machin said, they’re going along with it.<br>另一个原因是这是他们的合作伙伴想要的，即使他们自己并不那么热衷。如果你对某件事不热衷，那就意味着你 “对它不热衷”，这不是你真正想做的事情，但因为这是他们的伴侣想要的，所以他们同意了，或者正如 Machin 博士所说，他们同意了。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Yes, going along with something, is a phrase that means ‘agreeing to do’ something even though you don’t really want to do it. It’s interesting that Dr Machin said that some men admit to this. To admit to something is to say or agree that something is true even if you’re perhaps ashamed of it or you don’t want it to be true.<br>是的，顺从某事是一个短语，意思是“同意做”某事，即使你并不是真的想做。有趣的是，Machin 博士说，一些男性承认这一点。承认某事就是说或同意某件事是真的，即使你可能为此感到羞耻或你不希望它是真的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>There was one more reason she mentioned and that was that some men become parents because they want to be a better father than their own father had been. Let’s listen again.<br>她还提到了一个原因，那就是一些男人成为父母是因为他们想成为一个比自己的父亲更好的父亲。让我们再听一遍。</p><p>Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)<br>There’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family.

Here’s Dr Machin again.<br>那么，他们不喜欢一些父亲自己的爸爸的什么呢？又是 Machin 博士。</p><p>Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)<br>Well, in some cases, you know, the father would be neglectful, some fathers were absent and others they just felt they were a very, I suppose, we’d say a 1950s father so distant, disciplinarian not actually involved in their children’s daily life and certainly not involved in their care. So today’s generation fathers, even in the 10 years that I’ve been studying dads we’ve seen a massive evolution in how hands-on fathers are.<br>嗯，在某些情况下，你知道，父亲会疏忽大意，有些父亲缺席，而另一些父亲只是觉得自己非常，我想，我们会说一个 1950 年代的父亲如此疏远，管教者实际上没有参与孩子的日常生活，当然也没有参与他们的照顾。所以，今天的一代父亲，即使在我研究父亲的 10 年里，我们也看到了父亲亲力亲为的方式发生了巨大的变化。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>She talks there about some negative characteristics associated with dads in the past. She suggests that some fathers didn’t have a very close relationship with their sons, they were absent which means they weren’t at home a lot and ‘didn’t spend time’ with their children.<br>她在那里谈到了过去与父亲相关的一些负面特征。她认为，一些父亲与儿子的关系不是很密切，他们不在，这意味着他们不经常在家，并且“没有花时间”陪伴孩子。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Yes, and some fathers were seen as a disciplinarian. That describes someone whose main communication with their children was to give them strict rules and tell them off or punish them if they did something wrong.<br>是的，有些父亲被视为管教者。这描述了一个人与孩子的主要沟通是给他们严格的规则，如果他们做错了什么，就会责备他们或惩罚他们。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>These days, according to Dr Machin, fathers are much more hands-on. This phrase means they are ‘much more involved’ with their children and share bringing up their children with their partners.<br>根据 Machin 博士的说法，如今，父亲们更加亲力亲为。这句话的意思是他们“更多地参与”自己的孩子，并与伴侣共同抚养孩子。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And talking of sharing, Neil, come on – it’s time to know the answer to today’s question.<br>说到分享，Neil，来吧 —— 是时候知道今天问题的答案了。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes indeed. According to recent research in the UK, what is the percentage of fathers who are there when their children are born? Was it 55%, 75% or 95%?<br>确实是的。根据英国最近的研究，孩子出生时在场的父亲的百分比是多少？是 55%、75% 还是 95%？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And I said a very optimistic 95%.<br>我说非常乐观的 95%。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Being optimistic is good obviously because you are correct.<br>乐观显然是好的，因为你是对的。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>That’s fantastic!<br>太棒了！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And now, for something else fantastic, our review of today’s vocabulary…<br>现在，为了另一个很棒的事情，我们对今天词汇的回顾……</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>We started off with admit to for when you say something is true, even if it might make you look a little bit bad. And before we go on I have to admit, Neil, that it was me who ate your biscuit.<br>我们首先承认你说某件事是真的，即使它可能会让你看起来有点糟糕。在我们继续之前，我不得不承认，尼尔，是我吃了你的饼干。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Which one?<br>哪一个？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>The one that you left on the desk.<br>你留在桌子上的那个。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That’s all right. I wasn’t really keen on it anyway. It had been on the floor.<br>没关系。反正我并不是很热衷于它。它一直在地板上。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>What? Yuck!<br>什么？呸！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yeah, well, it serves you right! And to be keen on something is our next phrase, meaning ‘being very interested in and enthusiastic about’ something.<br>是的，嗯，它为您服务！而 to be keen on something 是我们的下一个短语，意思是 “对某事非常感兴趣和热情”。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Then we had to go along with something. This is when you agree to do something even if you are not keen on it.<br>然后我们不得不接受一些事情。这是你同意做某事的时候，即使你并不热衷于它。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>An absent father is one who is not at home to spend time with his children.<br>缺席的父亲是指不在家陪伴孩子的父亲。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And some fathers are disciplinarians.
