<p><strong>By Peter Vogt<br>Monster Contributing Writer</strong></p>
<p>You just got word that you landed a job interview with a company that really interests you – only there’s a slight catch.</p>
<p>You won’t be meeting with your interviewer(s) face to face. Instead, you’ll be taking part in a phone interview, the results of which will determine whether you’re invited to meet with company representatives in person.</p>
<p>Many companies use phone interviews as an initial employment screening technique for a variety of reasons. Because they’re generally brief, phone interviews save companies time. They also serve as a more realistic screening alternative for cases in which companies are considering out-of-town (or out-of-province and foreign) candidates.</p>
<p>So the chances are pretty good that, at some point in your job hunt, you’ll be asked to participate in a 20- to 30-minute phone interview with either one person or several people on the other end of the line. In many ways, the way you prepare for a phone interview isn’t all that different from the way you’d get ready for a face-to-face interview – save for a few slight additions to and modifications of your list of preparation tasks.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do:</p>
<p><strong>1. Treat the phone interview seriously, just as you would a face-to-face interview.</strong></p>
<p>A phone interview seems so informal on the surface that it can be easy to fall into the trap of “phoning it in” – i.e., not preparing for it as well as you would for an in-person interview. Don’t get caught with your guard down. Be sure to research the company, study the job description, and practice your responses to anticipated questions, just as you would for any other interview.</p>
<p><strong>2. Have your resume and cover letter in front of you.</strong></p>
<p>You’ll almost certainly be asked about some of the information that appears on these documents. You might also want to have in front of you any supporting materials that relate to information in your resume and cover letter, like documents you’ve designed or written, a portfolio of your various projects, or the written position description from your past positions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make a cheat sheet.</strong></p>
<p>Jot down a few notes about the most critical points you want to make with your interviewer(s). Are there certain skills and experiences you want to emphasize? Do you have certain interests or passions you want your interviewer(s) to know about and understand? Be sure these pieces of information appear on your crib sheet. Then touch on them during the interview, even if your only chance to do so is at the end of the session when the interviewer asks you if you have any questions or anything to add.</p>
<p><strong>4. Get a high-quality phone.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t the time to use a cell phone that cuts in and out, or a cheaply made phone that makes it difficult for you and your interviewer(s) to hear and understand each other.</p>
<p><strong>5. Shower, groom and dress up (at least a little).</strong></p>
<p>Odd advice? Perhaps. But focusing on your appearance, just as you would for a normal interview, will put you in the right frame of mind from a psychological standpoint. You won’t do as well in your phone interview if you’re lying in bed, for example, or if you’re draped over your couch in your pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>6. Stand up, or at least sit up straight at a table or desk.</strong></p>
<p>Again, there’s a psychological, frame of mind aspect to consider here. But on a more tangible level, research has shown that you project yourself better when you’re standing up, and you’ll feel more knowledgeable and confident.</p>
<p>Phone interviews can be tricky, especially since you aren’t able to read your interviewers’ nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language during the session – a big difference from the typical interview. But if you prepare well for your phone interview, you won’t need to read anyone’s nonverbals to gauge your performance. You’ll know for sure how you’ve done because you’ll be invited to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/different-types-of-interviews-canada">a face-to-face interview</a>, where you’ll have yet another opportunity to prove you’re the best person for the job.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just got word that you landed a job interview with a company that really interests you – only there’s a slight catch.<br>你刚刚收到消息说你得到了一家你真正感兴趣的公司的面试机会——只是有一个小问题。</p>
<p>You won’t be meeting with your interviewer(s) face to face. Instead, you’ll be taking part in a phone interview, the results of which will determine whether you’re invited to meet with company representatives in person.<br>您不会与面试官面对面会面。相反，您将参加电话面试，面试结果将决定您是否被邀请与公司代表亲自会面。</p>
<p>Many companies use phone interviews as an initial employment screening technique for a variety of reasons. Because they’re generally brief, phone interviews save companies time. They also serve as a more realistic screening alternative for cases in which companies are considering out-of-town (or out-of-province and foreign) candidates.<br>出于多种原因，许多公司使用电话面试作为初次就业筛选技术。由于电话面试通常很简短，因此可以节省公司的时间。对于公司正在考虑外地（或省外和外国）候选人的情况，它们还可以作为更现实的筛选替代方案。</p>
<p>So the chances are pretty good that, at some point in your job hunt, you’ll be asked to participate in a 20- to 30-minute phone interview with either one person or several people on the other end of the line. In many ways, the way you prepare for a phone interview isn’t all that different from the way you’d get ready for a face-to-face interview – save for a few slight additions to and modifications of your list of preparation tasks.<br>因此，很有可能，在您找工作的某个时刻，您会被要求参加一个 20 到 30 分钟的电话面试，面试对象可能是电话另一端的一个人，也可能是几个人。在很多方面，准备电话面试的方式与准备面对面面试的方式并没有什么不同——除了对准备清单进行一些细微的补充和修改之外任务。</p>
<p>Here’s what to do:<br>该怎么做：</p>
<p><strong>1. Treat the phone interview seriously, just as you would a face-to-face interview.</strong><br><strong>1. 认真对待电话面试，就像对待面对面面试一样。</strong></p>
<p>A phone interview seems so informal on the surface that it can be easy to fall into the trap of “phoning it in” – i.e., not preparing for it as well as you would for an in-person interview. Don’t get caught with your guard down. Be sure to research the company, study the job description, and practice your responses to anticipated questions, just as you would for any other interview.<br>电话面试表面上看起来非常非正式，很容易陷入“打电话面试”的陷阱——也就是说，没有像面对面面试那样做好准备。不要放松警惕。一定要研究公司，研究职位描述，并练习对预期问题的回答，就像任何其他面试一样。</p>
<p><strong>2. Have your resume and cover letter in front of you.</strong><br><strong>2. 将您的简历和求职信放在您的面前。</strong></p>
<p>You’ll almost certainly be asked about some of the information that appears on these documents. You might also want to have in front of you any supporting materials that relate to information in your resume and cover letter, like documents you’ve designed or written, a portfolio of your various projects, or the written position description from your past positions.<br>几乎肯定会询问您这些文档中出现的一些信息。您可能还需要准备与简历和求职信中的信息相关的任何支持材料，例如您设计或编写的文件、各种项目的组合或您过去职位的书面职位描述。</p>
<p><strong>3. Make a cheat sheet.</strong><br><strong>3. 制作备忘单。</strong></p>
<p>Jot down a few notes about the most critical points you want to make with your interviewer(s). Are there certain skills and experiences you want to emphasize? Do you have certain interests or passions you want your interviewer(s) to know about and understand? Be sure these pieces of information appear on your crib sheet. Then touch on them during the interview, even if your only chance to do so is at the end of the session when the interviewer asks you if you have any questions or anything to add.<br>记下一些关于您想向面试官提出的最关键观点的笔记。您想强调某些技能和经验吗？您是否有某些兴趣或热情希望面试官了解和理解？确保这些信息出现在您的备忘单上。然后在面试过程中触及它们，即使你唯一的机会是在面试结束时面试官问你是否有任何问题或有什么要补充的时候。</p>
<p><strong>4. Get a high-quality phone.</strong><br><strong>4. 买一部高质量的手机。</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t the time to use a cell phone that cuts in and out, or a cheaply made phone that makes it difficult for you and your interviewer(s) to hear and understand each other.<br>现在不是使用断断续续的手机或廉价手机的时候，因为这会让你和面试官很难听到和理解对方的声音。</p>
<p><strong>5. Shower, groom and dress up (at least a little).</strong><br><strong>5. 淋浴、打扮和打扮（至少一点点）。</strong></p>
<p>Odd advice? Perhaps. But focusing on your appearance, just as you would for a normal interview, will put you in the right frame of mind from a psychological standpoint. You won’t do as well in your phone interview if you’re lying in bed, for example, or if you’re draped over your couch in your pajamas.<br>奇怪的建议？也许。但是，就像在正常面试中一样，关注自己的外表，从心理学的角度来看，会让你处于正确的心态。例如，如果你躺在床上，或者穿着睡衣躺在沙发上，你在电话面试中的表现就不会那么好。</p>
<p><strong>6. Stand up, or at least sit up straight at a table or desk.</strong><br><strong>6. 站起来，或者至少在桌子或书桌前坐直。</strong></p>
<p>Again, there’s a psychological, frame of mind aspect to consider here. But on a more tangible level, research has shown that you project yourself better when you’re standing up, and you’ll feel more knowledgeable and confident.<br>同样，这里需要考虑心理、心态方面的因素。但在更具体的层面上，研究表明，当你站起来时，你可以更好地展现自己，你会感到更有知识和自信。</p>
<p>Phone interviews can be tricky, especially since you aren’t able to read your interviewers’ nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language during the session – a big difference from the typical interview. But if you prepare well for your phone interview, you won’t need to read anyone’s nonverbals to gauge your performance. You’ll know for sure how you’ve done because you’ll be invited to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/different-types-of-interviews-canada">a face-to-face interview</a>, where you’ll have yet another opportunity to prove you’re the best person for the job.<br>电话面试可能很棘手，特别是因为你无法在面试过程中阅读面试官的非语言线索，例如面部表情和肢体语言，这与典型的面试有很大不同。但如果你为电话面试做好充分准备，你就不需要阅读任何人的非语言来衡量你的表现。您会确切地知道自己的表现，因为您将被邀请参加面对面的面试，在那里您将有另一个机会证明自己是该职位的最佳人选。</p>
