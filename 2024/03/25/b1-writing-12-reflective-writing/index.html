<p>In January I spent three weeks volunteering as an English teacher in my town. I’ve been thinking about becoming an English teacher for a while so it was a good opportunity to see what it’s like. The students had all just arrived to start a new life in the UK and they had a range of levels from beginner to intermediate. They came from a variety of countries and had very different backgrounds and experiences.</p>
<p>For me, the most important thing was the relationship with the students. I was nervous at first and did not feel confident about speaking in front of people. However, I found it easy to build good relationships with the students as a class and as individuals and I soon relaxed with them. It was a challenge to encourage the lower-level students to speak in English, but at least they understood a lot more at the end of the course.</p>
<p>At first, planning lessons took a really long time and I was not happy with the results. Classes seemed to be too difficult for some students and too easy for others, who finished quickly and got bored. I found it was better to teach without a course book, adapting materials I found online to suit their needs. I learned to take extra activities for students who finished early and that was much better.</p>
<p>I still need to continue improving my lesson planning. I would like more ideas for teaching mixed-ability groups and I want to plan the whole course better next time. That way students have a focus for each lesson and a sense of progress and of what they’ve covered. I’m also going to put more confident students with beginners when they work in pairs so conversation activities give everyone more chance to speak and students can help each other.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a really positive experience and I learned a lot. I’ve decided that I would like to become an English teacher in the future.</p>

The students had all just arrived to start a new life in the UK and they had a range of levels from beginner to intermediate. They came from a variety of countries and had very different backgrounds and experiences.<br>一月份，我在我的镇上做了三个星期的志愿英语老师。我想成为一名英语老师已经有一段时间了，所以这是一个很好的机会来看看它是什么样的。这些学生都刚刚抵达英国开始新生活，他们的水平从初级到中级不等。他们来自不同的国家，有着截然不同的背景和经历。</p>
<p>For me, the most important thing was the relationship with the students. I was nervous at first and did not feel confident about speaking in front of people. However, I found it easy to build good relationships with the students as a class and as individuals and I soon relaxed with them. It was a challenge to encourage the lower-level students to speak in English, but at least they understood a lot more at the end of the course.<br>对我来说，最重要的是和学生的关系。起初我很紧张，对在人们面前演讲没有信心。然而，我发现与学生作为班级和个人建立良好的关系很容易，我很快就与他们放松下来。鼓励水平较低的学生说英语是一个挑战，但至少他们在课程结束时理解了更多。</p>
<p>At first, planning lessons took a really long time and I was not happy with the results. Classes seemed to be too difficult for some students and too easy for others, who finished quickly and got bored. I found it was better to teach without a course book, adapting materials I found online to suit their needs. I learned to take extra activities for students who finished early and that was much better.<br>起初，计划课程花了很长时间，我对结果并不满意。课程对一些学生来说似乎太难了，而对另一些学生来说又太简单了，他们很快就学完了并感到无聊。我发现最好在没有教科书的情况下进行教学，调整我在网上找到的材料来满足他们的需求。我学会了为提前完成学业的学生参加额外的活动，这要好得多。</p>
<p>I still need to continue improving my lesson planning. I would like more ideas for teaching mixed-ability groups and I want to plan the whole course better next time. That way students have a focus for each lesson and a sense of progress and of what they’ve covered. I’m also going to put more confident students with beginners when they work in pairs so conversation activities give everyone more chance to speak and students can help each other.<br>我还需要继续改进我的备课。我想要更多关于教授混合能力小组的想法，并且我想下次更好地计划整个课程。这样，学生就能专注于每节课，并对自己所学内容有一种进步感。我还将让更有信心的学生与初学者结对工作，这样对话活动就可以让每个人都有更多的机会说话，学生也可以互相帮助。</p>
<p>Overall, it was a really positive experience and I learned a lot. I’ve decided that I would like to become an English teacher in the future.<br>总的来说，这是一次非常积极的经历，我学到了很多东西。我决定将来要成为一名英语老师。</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reflective writing is more personal than other types of academic writing. You can use the first person (<em>I …</em> , <em>My …</em> , etc.) and explain how you felt.反思性写作比其他类型的学术写作更加个人化。您可以使用第一人称（我…、我的…等）并解释您的感受。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Think about the experience in detail. Explain what went well and what was challenging, and say what you learned in the process.详细思考一下经历。解释哪些进展顺利，哪些有挑战性，并说出您在这个过程中学到了什么。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a structure:</p>
