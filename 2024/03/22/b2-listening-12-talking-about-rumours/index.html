<p><strong>Will:</strong> Kiera, have you heard John isn’t coming back and they might even fire him?</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> No! I knew he was away but I thought it was for personal reasons?</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> I’m pretty sure that’s not the full story. Have you ever worked with him?</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> A long time ago, but … well, I’ve heard stories about him for years.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> I’ve never worked with him directly but I know people that have and they say he was always shouting and screaming, threatening to fire people. And Susanne told me he took credit for one of her ideas. She had this idea for a project and she brought it up at the monthly creative workshop and he liked it – everybody did. But she saw the notes from the meeting and there was no mention of her name anywhere. John had agreed with her and repeated some of the things she said and the notes made it look like they were his ideas in the first place. He made her do all the work planning it, then when the project actually got started – it was that cars one – Susanne was moved to something else.</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> It won an award, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> Yeah, but Susanne didn’t get to share it – there was zero recognition of her contribution. She was furious but she couldn’t do anything about it. Not if she wanted to keep her job.</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> Yeah, it’s almost impossible to report people who are as high up as John is, or was.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> How did you find working with him, then?</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> Well, you know what you said about him shouting at people? I’ve been in meetings with him and we all learned to keep our mouths shut. It was horrible. People were genuinely afraid of him.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> Did you ever see him stealing people’s ideas?</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> It was never that obvious. He was a genius. He had incredible vision but, you know, there was a whole team of people working with him. Not every single idea came from him and after a while it’s not easy to say, ‘Oh, this idea was mine and this idea was yours.’ For me, the bigger problem was that you could be in his good books and then suddenly, with no explanation, you were out. And if you were out, life got very difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> I heard women in particular had a hard time working with him.</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> Yeah, well, like I said, you had to stay in his good books. So, if there was a comment that made you feel uncomfortable, you didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> Did that happen to you?</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> Not to me, no, but we all knew … and no one said anything. And I was lucky I didn’t have that much contact with him myself.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> They’re doing a full investigation so I suppose a lot of these stories are going to come to light.</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> I hope so. I really hope he’s not coming back.</p>

<p><strong>Will:</strong> Kiera, have you heard John isn’t coming back and they might even fire him?<br>威尔：基拉，你听说约翰不会回来了，他们甚至可能会解雇他吗？</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> No! I knew he was away but I thought it was for personal reasons?<br>基拉：不！我知道他不在，但我认为这是出于个人原因？</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> I’m pretty sure that’s not the full story. Have you ever worked with him?<br>威尔：我很确定这不是故事的全部。你曾经和他一起工作过吗？</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> A long time ago, but … well, I’ve heard stories about him for years.<br>基拉：很久以前了，但是……好吧，我多年来一直听到有关他的故事。</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> I’ve never worked with him directly but I know people that have and they say he was always shouting and screaming, threatening to fire people. And Susanne told me he took credit for one of her ideas. She had this idea for a project and she brought it up at the monthly creative workshop and he liked it – everybody did.

John had agreed with her and repeated some of the things she said and the notes made it look like they were his ideas in the first place. He made her do all the work planning it, then when the project actually got started – it was that cars one – Susanne was moved to something else.<br>威尔：我从未直接与他共事过，但我知道有人曾与他共事过，他们说他总是大喊大叫，威胁要解雇员工。苏珊娜告诉我，他把她的一个想法归功于他。她有一个项目的想法，并在每月的创意研讨会上提出，他很喜欢——每个人都喜欢。但她看到了会议记录，没有任何地方提到她的名字。约翰同意她的观点，并重复了她所说的一些事情，这些笔记让这些看起来像是他最初的想法。他让她做所有的工作规划，然后当项目真正开始时——这是汽车项目——苏珊娜被转移到其他事情上。</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> It won an award, didn’t it?<br>基拉：它获奖了，不是吗？</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> Yeah, but Susanne didn’t get to share it – there was zero recognition of her contribution. She was furious but she couldn’t do anything about it. Not if she wanted to keep her job.<br>威尔：是的，但苏珊娜没有分享它——对她的贡献的认可度为零。她很愤怒，却又无能为力。如果她想保住工作就不会做任何事。</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> Yeah, it’s almost impossible to report people who are as high up as John is, or was.<br>基拉：是的，几乎不可能举报像约翰这样或曾经处于高位的人。</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> How did you find working with him, then?<br>威尔：那你觉得和他一起工作怎么样？</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> Well, you know what you said about him shouting at people? I’ve been in meetings with him and we all learned to keep our mouths shut. It was horrible. People were genuinely afraid of him.<br>基拉：好吧，你知道你说过他对别人大喊大叫吗？我和他开过会，我们都学会了闭嘴。那太差了。人们真的很害怕他。</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> Did you ever see him stealing people’s ideas?<br>威尔：你见过他窃取人们的想法吗？</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> It was never that obvious. He was a genius. He had incredible vision but, you know, there was a whole team of people working with him. Not every single idea came from him and after a while it’s not easy to say, ‘Oh, this idea was mine and this idea was yours.’ For me, the bigger problem was that you could be in his good books and then suddenly, with no explanation, you were out. And if you were out, life got very difficult.<br>Kiera：这从来都不是那么明显。他是个天才。他有着令人难以置信的远见，但是，你知道，有一整个团队的人与他一起工作。并非每个想法都来自他，过了一段时间后，就很难说，“哦，这个想法是我的，这个想法是你的。”对我来说，更大的问题是你可能被他<strong>看重</strong>，然后突然之间，没有任何解释，你就出局了。如果你出去了，生活就会变得非常困难。</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> I heard women in particular had a hard time working with him.<br>威尔：我听说女性在与他共事时尤其困难。</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> Yeah, well, like I said, you had to stay in his good books. So, if there was a comment that made you feel uncomfortable, you didn’t say anything.<br>基拉：是的，就像我说的，你必须让他喜欢你。所以，如果有评论让你感到不舒服，你就什么也不说。</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> Did that happen to you?<br>威尔：你遇到过这种情况吗？</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> Not to me, no, but we all knew … and no one said anything. And I was lucky I didn’t have that much contact with him myself.<br>基拉：对我来说不是，不，但我们都知道……而且没有人说什么。我很幸运，我自己并没有和他有太多的接触。</p>
