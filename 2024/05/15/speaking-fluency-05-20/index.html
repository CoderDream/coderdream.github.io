<p><strong>表达困惑</strong></p>
<p>这节课我们来学几个地道的说法表达困惑不解。</p>
<p>句型<br>beyond me<br>Don’t ask me.<br>out of one’s depth<br>over one’s head</p>
<p><strong>beyond me</strong><br>Beyond me的意思是”超出我的理解范围”。<br>This is beyond me.就是”这件事我无法理解。<br>这个表达比I don’t know听起来更高级。</p>
<p>例如：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I realize that sometimes I get too caught up in my career that I forget other things that are also important. Do you think Brandon felt it too?<br>我意识到自己有时太专注事业，导致忽略了其他重要的事。你觉得 Brandon 是不是也察觉到了？</p>
<p>That’s <strong>beyond me</strong>, Jane. I’ve never had long-term relationships like you and Brandon.<br>我也不知道，Jane。我从来没有过像你和 Brandon那样长久的关系。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why she loves sports so much is <strong>beyond me</strong>.<br>我无法理解她为什么这么喜欢运动。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize that sometimes I get too caught up in my career that I forget other things that are also important. Do you think Brandon felt it too?<br>That’s beyond me, Jane. I’ve never had long-term relationships like you and Brandon.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>对话中，Rebecca 用That’s beyond me.来表示她对 Jane 在恋爱中遇到的问题因为没经历过，所以无法理解也帮不上忙。</p>
<p>Why she loves sports so much is beyond me.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>Beyond me用来表示说话人无法理解女生为什么那么爱运动。</p>
<p><strong>Don’t ask me.</strong><br>Don’t ask me.直译是”别问我”，引申过来就是”我也不知道”的意思。<br>这句的用法和中文的逻辑相似。<br>例如:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did she break up with her boyfriend?<br>她为什么会跟男朋友分手？<br><strong>Don’t ask me</strong>. How should I know?<br>别问我，我怎么可能知道？</li>
<li>How much sugar do I need for the cake?<br>做这个蛋糕需要多少糖？<br><strong>Don’t ask me.</strong> Cooking is not my strong suit.<br>别问我，做饭我并不擅长。</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did she break up with her boyfriend?<br>Don’t ask me. How should I know?<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>对话中，Don’t ask me.表达男生也不知道两人为何分手。</p>
<p>The stuff they’re teaching in this advanced class is <strong>beyond me</strong>.</p>
<p>别问我<br><strong>Don’t ask me</strong>. Cooking is not my strong suit.</p>
<p>我也不理解<br>That’s <strong>beyond me</strong>.</p>
<p>You know better than I do about this. <strong>Don’t ask me</strong>.</p>
<p>我不知道<br>That’s <strong>beyond me</strong>. You could ask someone there at the info desk.</p>
<p>别问我<br><strong>Don’t ask me</strong>. It’s not me anyway.</p>
<p>I can’t give you a helpful suggestion. I’m sorry, but photography is far <strong>beyond me</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t ask me.</strong> Go and ask the unpredictable traffic.</p>
<p><strong>out of one’s depth</strong><br><strong>Out of one’s depth</strong> 字面意思是”水面没过某人头顶”，我们用它来形容”某件事超出某人理解能力，力所不能及”。<br>例如：<br>When they started talking about philosophy, I was <strong>out of my depth</strong>.<br>当他们开始讨论哲学的时候，我已经听不明白了。<br>He felt <strong>out of his depth</strong> after moving to a new country.<br>他在到一个新国家后感到无所适从。</p>
<p>When they started talking about philosophy, I was out of my depth.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>Out of one’s depth这里用于表现男生对哲学话题一窍不通。</p>
<p><strong>over one’s head</strong><br><strong>Over one’s head</strong> 字面意思是指”飞过某人头顶”，实际也可以用来形容某事过于复杂超出某人理解范围。<br>这个短语常用动词go来搭配使用。<br>例如:<br>I tried to listen to his speech about the new technology, but most of it went over my head.<br>我尝试听懂他关于新技术的演讲，但是大部分内容我都无法理解。<br> The explanation went completely <strong>over my head</strong>.<br>我完全看不懂这个解释。</p>
<p>I tried to listen to his speech about the new technology, but most of it went over my head.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>Over one’s head 这里表示他大部分都没有听懂。</p>
<p>He felt <strong>out of his depth</strong> after moving to a new country.</p>
<p>The explanation went completely <strong>over my head</strong>.</p>
<p>I think what you asked him to do is probably <strong>out of his depth</strong>.</p>
<p>He was unwilling to admit that most of the concepts <strong>went way over his head</strong>.</p>
<p>大部分笑话我都不太明白<br>I admit that most of the jokes went <strong>right over my head</strong>.</p>
<p>实在学不明白<br>I felt so <strong>out of my depth</strong> after the first three weeks that I had to give up.</p>
<p>Yes, but I decided to move to another intermediate course.<br>The intermediate course was beyond me as well<br><strong>I felt out of my depth in class</strong><br>I like the style of this professor</p>
<p><strong>表达困惑</strong><br>太棒啦！你刚刚又学会了四种表达困惑的方法。下面来复习一下:</p>
<ul>
<li>beyond me</li>
<li>Don’t ask me.</li>
<li>out of one’s depth</li>

<p>没前途的工作<br><strong>Maybe it’s time to start looking for something new. A dead-end job can drain you.</strong><br>Don’t be so negative. Things could turn out fine.<br>You should try to find your purpose in life.</p>

<p>工作乏味一成不变<br>It’s good news. At least you got yourself a stable job.<br>Well, the pay is pretty good, right?<br><strong>If you take this job, you’ll be stuck in a rut in a few years.</strong></p>
<p>采取主动<br>Let’s discuss your ideas and create a plan of action together.<br><strong>Maybe it’s time for you to take the initiative and start driving the project forward.</strong><br>You can reach out to the team and see if anyone else is willing to step up.</p>
<p>行程太紧张了<br>With such limited time, we should consider cutting down on stops.<br><strong>You’ll be on a tight schedule. Maybe it’s best to prioritize must-see destinations.</strong><br>Let’s plan our route carefully to ensure we don’t miss out on any key attractions.</p>
<p>A <strong>dead end job</strong> doesn’t have a lot of opportunities and won’t lead to a good future.</p>
<p>They’ve laid off the <strong>night shift</strong> due to the economic downturn.</p>
<p>What time do you <strong>knock off work</strong>? We can have a drink at the bar.</p>
