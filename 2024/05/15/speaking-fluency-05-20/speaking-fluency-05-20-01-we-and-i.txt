A: Thanks for taking part in this video, Henry.
B: No problem.
A: So, how does it feel having a star in your family?
B: We're proud of what Cora has accomplished. She works really hard.
A: I'm curious, why did she decide to make such a big change?
B: It just became clear to her that she needed to make music.
A: Why do you say that?
B: Well, when we first met, she was involved in the local music scene and played a lot of open mics around town.
A: She was a cheerful and outgoing person then.
B: Was?
A: After we settled into family life, her personality changed.
B: She became really unhappy and we fought all the time. It felt like we were on the point of ending our marriage if something didn't change.
A: That sounds tough. Did you try talking to her about this? About the change of her personality?
B: Yeah. She told me that between kids and work, she didn't have time for music. She felt stifled.
A: Do you think the move helped?
B: It sure did. During our last video call, she seemed so lively and determined to succeed. I can tell that the old Cora is back.
A: That's great. I think it's amazing of you to support her choice.
B: Well, I love her and I only want what's best for her.
