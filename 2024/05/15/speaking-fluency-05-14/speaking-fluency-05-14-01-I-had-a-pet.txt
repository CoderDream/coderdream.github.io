It's finally Friday. Do you have any plans on the weekend?
Yeah, I have a few things to do.
My new laptop has been delivered, so I plan to install some software onto it.
I also bought a new piano. I've had my old piano for ages, and it has been worn down by all my playing.
Wow, you shopped a lot. Yeah, after my mom's house had been sold, she lent me some money.
So I still have to work hard to pay her back.
I see. But anyways, enjoy your weekend.
