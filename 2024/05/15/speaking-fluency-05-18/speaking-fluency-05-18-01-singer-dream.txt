翻译，一句英文一句中文：
Oh, I love this one!
Me too.
I knew that Cora was a talented singer, but I had no idea that she was this good.
So what's this video about again?
It's about Cora.
She's so brave for taking a risk and going after what she wants.
So I want to share that story with others by making a video about her life.
First, I want to ask, what was she like as a kid?
Well, as a kid she loved singing and performing for us.
She even used to line up her stuffed animals and hold concerts for them.
That's so cute!
Sounds like she was an adorable kid.
Yeah, as a kid she was.
Though she did cause us some trouble as she got older.
