翻译，一句英文一句中文：
Teenage Cora, she was such a pain.
Robert?
What? It's true. She was always skipping class to practice with her band or going out to concerts without our permission.
It felt like there was almost nothing we could do to control her behavior.
It sounds like she was just passionate about music.

As I was saying, Cora used to get into all sorts of trouble as a teenager.
Robert?
