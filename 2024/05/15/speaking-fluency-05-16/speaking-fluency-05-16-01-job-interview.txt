Hello, I'm Peter.
Hello, I'm Mindy.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Thank you for rescheduling the interview.
I had been doing a lot of volunteer work the night before the interview, so I was too tired
the next day and wasn't able to come to the interview.
Oh, no problem at all.
Why don't we start by having you tell me a little bit about yourself?
Sure.
I just completed my master's degree in architecture at Summer University.
For the past three years, I have worked as an intern at a local architecture firm.
I am also a volunteer at a local art school.
That's very impressive.
Why don't you tell me more about why you want to work here in particular?
Well, this architecture firm has an excellent reputation.
I like the company culture.
Even though it is a small firm, it offers room for growth.
Great.
Okay.
Now, tell me more about your experience.
What are your strengths?
I am organized and efficient.
I can always finish projects ahead of schedule.
Excellent.
One last question, why do you think we should choose you over other candidates?
Going to school while working part-time required a lot of discipline and time management skills.
I can step into the next role and quickly be successful.
Okay, great.
Thank you so much for coming in today, Mindy.
We will be contacting the final candidates to come in for second interviews in two weeks.
Thank you.
I appreciate this opportunity.
Thank you.
