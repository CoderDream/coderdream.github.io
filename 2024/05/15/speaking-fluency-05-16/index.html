<p>Dear Logan, I’m writing to tell you about something that happened to me last Saturday.</p>
<p>When I got home that night, I discovered that my TV <strong>had been turned</strong> on. And I remembered turning it off before leaving.</p>
<p>Besides that, I heard a noise in the kitchen. I went in and found that the tap <strong>had been turned</strong> on and the water was running.</p>
<p>I was terrified. The door was locked so I didn’t know how these things happened. I called the police and they checked the CCTV footage. It turns out a cat had broken in my house!</p>
<p>He had slipped in through an open window, stepped on the TV monitor, and then bumped the tap in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Just last night, he got back in and tried to walk around my place again, but that time I was home.</p>
<p>Was I upset? Of course not! I named him Michael, and he <strong>has been loved</strong> by me since then.</p>
<p>I gave him food and he seemed to like it. Now I have a pet!</p>

<p>由于在地震这个发生在<strong>过去的时间之前</strong>，建筑已经被毁灭了，因此我们使用过去完成时。而建筑是被毁灭，因此我们使用被动语态。</p>
<p>过去完成时的被动语态的结构为：某人&#x2F;某物+had(not)+been + done+（by某人&#x2F;某人）</p>

<p>过去完成时的被动语态的结构为：某人&#x2F;某物+had(not)+been+done+（by某人&#x2F;某人）。</p>
<p>主动语态表示主语为动作的<strong>执行者</strong>；被动语态表示主语为动作的<strong>承受者</strong>。比如：</p>
<p>They had locked the door before they left.(主动语态)<br>在离开之前，他们已经锁好了门。</p>
<p>The door <strong>had been locked</strong> before they left.(被动语态)<br>门已经被锁好了，在他们离开之前。</p>
<p>过去完成时的被动语态表示过去某一时间以前已经被完成的动作，常与by，before等引导的时间状语连用。比如:</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to have you in this role,Brandon. Before we start though, I’d like to ask you about your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Sure. One of  my strengths is that I’m very hard-working. Once, in my previous job, I had been working late when I noticed a problem in the company software. Instead of waiting until the morning to fix it, I stayed another two hours in the office.</p>
<p>In general, that’s a very good quality to have in this company. What about a weakness?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes when I’m busy, it becomes hard to stay organized. For example, my previous boss once told me to clean my desk, because I had been ignoring how messy it was.</p>

<p>What does Mike think of his performance in the interview?<br>He thinks the interviewers were convinced by his answers.<br>He thinks he left a good impression.<br><strong>He thinks he messed it up.</strong></p>
<p>convincingly<br>讲解<br>convincingly有说服力地，使人信服地。来自于动词<br>convince说服某人。</p>
<p>ace<br>讲解<br>ace取得好成绩。作动词表示be successful in something</p>

<p>gauge one’s reactions<br>讲解<br>gauge one’s reactions 判断某人的反应。gauge作动词除了表示测量，还可以表示判定，判断〔人们的情感或意图）。</p>

<p><strong>面试经历1</strong><br>不论是工作面试还是学业面试，想必许多人都有着自己的面试心得。那么要怎样描述自己的面试经历呢？让我们一起来学学英文中的相关表述吧！</p>
<p>来看看对话中出现的表达</p>
<ul>
<li>leave a good impression</li>
<li>do one’s homework</li>
<li>stumble over one’s words</li>
</ul>
<p>You should try to leave a good impression on your first day in the office.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>leave a good impression 留下好印象。动词leave也可以替换成make；leave an impression on someone就等于leave someone with an impression; 形容词good可以替换成 bad&#x2F;strong&#x2F;deep等词。</p>
<p>Be sure you do your homework before heading into that meeting.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>do one’s homework 表示准备充分，充分了解（某个领域的信息），通常是在某次重要行动之前。这个短语大家熟知的意思是完成作业，但它也可以表示prepare&#x2F;do some research for something 在做决定或者行动之前，充分了解各方资讯。</p>
<p>I hope I don’t stumble over any of the long words.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>stumble over one’s words口吃，结巴，口齿不清。stumble over这个动词短语表示被绊倒，比如stumble over a rock被石头绊倒，或者表示走路跟跎。面试的时候如果因为太紧张而口齿不清，就可以用这个表达。</p>
<p>I always do my homework before I make big purchases.</p>
<p>I tend to stumble over my words a lot when speaking to new people, no matter what we are talking about.</p>
<p>Her language skill left a deep impression on the interviewer.</p>
<p>做好攻略<br><strong>You’d better do your homework</strong>.<br>You should study the map carefully.<br>Be careful about the weather. It’s unpredictable.</p>
<p>口吃<br>Don’t mention it. I was too nervous to speak up.<br>I killed it! The audience is amazing.<br><strong>It was a nightmare. I kept stumbling over my words.</strong></p>
<p>没留下好印象<br>Unfortunately he didn’t <strong>make</strong> a good <strong>impression</strong> on the big boss.</p>
<p><strong>面试经历2</strong><br>不论是工作面试还是学业面试，想必许多人都有着自己的面试心得。那么要怎样描述自己的面试经历呢？让我们一起来学学英文中的相关表述吧！</p>
<p>常用表达有</p>
<ul>
<li>make eye contact</li>
<li>go through the motions</li>
<li>do a trial run</li>
</ul>
<p>You should make eye contact with your interviewer when having an interview.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>make eye contact 眼神接触，眼神交流。eye contact是一个常用的表达，表示对视，动词make可以替换成maintain保持，或者avoid避免等。</p>
<p>The interviewer was just going through the motions when they asked me questions.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>go through the motions 走过场，心不在焉，敷衍。motion表示移动的动作。这个短语可以理解为你在做并不想做的事，没有用心，只是身体机械地移动，走走过场。如果在面试中面试官对面试者不感兴趣，可能就会走过场问问题，敷衍了事。</p>
<p>If you can, ask a friend to do a trial run with you before  an interview.<br><strong>讲解</strong><br>do a trial run 试验；体验。a trial run表示的就是正式行动之前的模拟或试验。在面试之前的模拟面试和面试练习都可以叫做a trial run</p>
<p>People who are lying tend to avoid eye contact.</p>
<p>I feel so bored at work, like I’m just going through the motions.</p>
<p>I did a trial run and it went about as good as you could expect.</p>
<p>先试验一下<br><strong>What about doing a trial run? Like renting an apartment first?</strong><br>You’re right. We should try it out.<br>Good idea. Let’s give it a shot.</p>
<p>敷衍了事<br>Why bother? The professor is just <strong>going</strong> through the <strong>motions</strong> anyway.</p>
<p>Try to maintain good eye contact with the interviewers, especially in a formal interview.</p>
<p><strong>小结</strong><br>不错！你刚刚学会了如何用口语描述面试经历。<br>来复习一下：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>leave a good impression</p>
</li>
<li><p>do one’s homework</p>
</li>
<li><p>stumble over one’s words</p>
</li>
<li><p>make eye contact</p>
</li>
<li><p>go through the motions</p>
</li>
<li><p>do a trial run</p>
<p>趁热打铁，我们来做个综合对话练习吧！</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>走过场<br>They are too busy with commuting to and from the office every day.<br><strong>They are just going through the motions instead of living their lives.</strong><br>They are rushing to the next destination all the time.</p>
<p>眼神接触<br><strong>Don’t make any eye contact with him or he will spot you!</strong><br>Don’t look at him. It’s dangerous.<br>We shouldn’t touch his eyes.</p>
<p>This long holiday gave others a trial run at what retirement could be like.</p>
<p>Make sure you do your homework and find out as much as possible about the company before the interview.</p>
<p>Arriving late for an interview gives a very negative impression.</p>
<p>口吃<br>Sometimes he can still stumble over words but he delivers a clear message.</p>
