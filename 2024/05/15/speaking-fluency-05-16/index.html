<p>Dear Logan, I’m writing to tell you about something that happened to me last Saturday.</p>
<p>When I got home that night, I discovered that my TV <strong>had been turned</strong> on. And I remembered turning it off before leaving.</p>
<p>Besides that, I heard a noise in the kitchen. I went in and found that the tap <strong>had been turned</strong> on and the water was running.</p>
<p>I was terrified. The door was locked so I didn’t know how these things happened. I called the police and they checked the CCTV footage. It turns out a cat had broken in my house!</p>
<p>He had slipped in through an open window, stepped on the TV monitor, and then bumped the tap in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Just last night, he got back in and tried to walk around my place again, but that time I was home.</p>
<p>Was I upset? Of course not! I named him Michael, and he <strong>has been loved</strong> by me since then.</p>
<p>I gave him food and he seemed to like it. Now I have a pet!</p>

<p>改为被动句<br>The cake <strong>has been eaten</strong> by him.</p>
<p>He has eaten the cake.<br>他已经吃了蛋糕。</p>
<p>这句话的被动句应该为：</p>
<p>The cake <strong>has been eaten</strong> by him.<br>蛋糕已经被他吃了。</p>
<p><strong>现在完成时</strong>的被动语态是某人&#x2F;某物+has&#x2F;have(not)+been+done +(by某人&#x2F;某物)</p>

<p>How many buildings <strong>had been destroyed</strong> when the earthquake ended?<br>在地震结束时，有多少建筑已经被毁灭了？</p>
<p>由于在地震这个发生在<strong>过去的时间之前</strong>，建筑已经被毁灭了，因此我们使用过去完成时。而建筑是被毁灭，因此我们使用被动语态。</p>
<p>过去完成时的被动语态的结构为：某人&#x2F;某物+had(not)+been + done+（by某人&#x2F;某人）</p>

<p>过去完成时的被动语态的结构为：某人&#x2F;某物+had(not)+been+done+（by某人&#x2F;某人）。</p>
<p>主动语态表示主语为动作的<strong>执行者</strong>；被动语态表示主语为动作的<strong>承受者</strong>。比如：</p>
<p>They had locked the door before they left.(主动语态)<br>在离开之前，他们已经锁好了门。</p>
<p>The door <strong>had been locked</strong> before they left.(被动语态)<br>门已经被锁好了，在他们离开之前。</p>
<p>过去完成时的被动语态表示过去某一时间以前已经被完成的动作，常与by，before等引导的时间状语连用。比如:</p>
<p>The car <strong>had been repaired</strong> by the time he got there.<br>在他到那里的时候，车已经被修好了。</p>
