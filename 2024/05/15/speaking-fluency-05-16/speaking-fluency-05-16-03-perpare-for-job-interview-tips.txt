It is important that you know how to prepare.
First of all, make sure you feel prepared on the basics.
Your background, your strengths and weaknesses,
how your skills match the job,
and why you want to work for the company.
Next, don't forget to research the company
before you go in for an interview.
It is important to find out what kind of reputation the company has.
In addition, make sure you understand the position you are applying for,
such as what role you would be playing on the team.
Finally, during the interview, sit up straight in your chair,
make eye contact, and smile warmly.
Show your passion for the position, and you should do fine.
