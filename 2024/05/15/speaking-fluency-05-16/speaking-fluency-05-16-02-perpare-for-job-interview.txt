翻译下面的文字，给我一句英文接一句中文翻译：
Last week, I had an interview at my favorite company.
I had been searching for a job like this for weeks before I finally spotted one online.
I felt confident before the interview because I had been preparing for it a lot.
But I had been thinking about rescheduling it a few hours before the interview.
I hadn't really been sleeping well the night before.
It had been raining all night and the noise had kept me awake.
However, I decided to just go and get it over with.
I had been waiting for days until they finally called me.
It turns out that, against all odds, I nailed it.
What a relief!

上周，我在我最喜欢的公司参加了面试。  
我在网上找到这份工作的前几周一直在寻找类似的职位。  
面试前我感到很有信心，因为我已经做了很多准备。  
但面试前几个小时我一直在考虑是否要重新安排时间。  
前一晚我真的没有睡好。  
整晚都在下雨，噪音让我无法入睡。  
然而，我决定还是去面试，把它完成。  
我等了好几天，他们才终于给我打电话。  
结果出乎意料，我成功了。  
真是太让人松了口气了！
