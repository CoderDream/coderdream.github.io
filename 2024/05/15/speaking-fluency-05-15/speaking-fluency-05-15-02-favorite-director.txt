给我中英文双语对照版，一句英文一句中文：
A: Please welcome our next guest, the director, Stephen Aarons.
B: Thank you, Eric. It’s great to be here.
A: Your most famous movie, Fangs, came out in 1995. To this day, I still get frightened every time I watch it.
B: Well, that’s great.
A: So many of your films are like that. You can watch them over and over again because they are original and timeless. What inspires you?
B: Imagining life in the past inspires me.
A: Can you tell us more about that?
B: Yes, after I had been studying film for a few years, I began looking at my family’s history. I would imagine my great-grandparents’ lives, where they lived, what they ate, how they laughed, and how they cried.
A: And your films let moviegoers experience these powerful times in the past, like your most recent movie about World War II, for example.
B: Yes, making that film was particularly meaningful for me.
A: Why is that?
B: It was a way to honor my family. I had not even been thinking about making a film about that subject, but I felt inspired by my family history.
A: Do you think you will ever stop making films?
B: I had actually been considering retirement, but an agent recently sent me a great script that I couldn’t turn down.
A: Well, that’s good news for me and all of your fans.
