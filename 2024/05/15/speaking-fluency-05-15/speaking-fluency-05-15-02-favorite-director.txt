I can't believe that you are a moviegoer just like me.
So who is your favorite director of all time?
It's got to be Hitchcock.
Nobody had started making scary movies until he did.
Definitely one of the masters.
For me, it's Miyazaki.
I feel like I hadn't been living until I saw Princess Mononoke.
Oh, yeah.
I hadn't been thinking of animated films.
And there are so many more.
Scorsese, Spielberg, Kurosawa?
Uh-oh.
I had been planning on leaving half an hour ago.
We had been having such a good conversation
that I lost track of time.
