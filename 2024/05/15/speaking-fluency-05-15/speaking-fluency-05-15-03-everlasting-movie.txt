给我中英文双语对照版，每句话都翻译，一句英语一句中文：
To this day, movies are popular. 
People can now watch movies on their phones, at any time and anywhere. 
But it wasn't always this way. 
The very first American movie theater opened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1905. 
For the first time, entire audiences could see the latest original movies from Hollywood shown on a big screen. 
At first, moviegoers sat on hard wooden chairs, but then, palace movie theaters opened. 
At palace movie theaters, the audience sat on soft velvet seats.
After people had been spending money on food and drinks outside of movie theaters for a long time, the theaters saw an opportunity.  
So, the movie theaters then began selling food and drinks too. 
What better way to have a meaningful connection with a movie than by watching it in a theater with other moviegoers?
While the way we watch movies may change, the way we enjoy them is timeless.
