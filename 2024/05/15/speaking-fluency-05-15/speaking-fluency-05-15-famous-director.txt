Please welcome our next guest, the director, Stephen Arons.
Thank you, Eric.
It's great to be here.
Your most famous movie, Fangs, came out in 1995.
To this day, I still get frightened every time
I watch it.
Well, that's great.
So many of your films are like that.
You can watch them over and over again
because they are original and timeless.
What inspires you?
Imagining life in the past inspires me.
Can you tell us more about that?
Yes.
After I had been studying film for a few years,
I began looking at my family's history.
I would imagine my great-grandparents' lives,
where they lived, what they ate, how they laughed,
and how they cried.
And your films let moviegoers experience
these powerful times in the past,
like your most recent movie about World War II, for example.
Yes.
Making that film was particularly meaningful for me.
Why is that?
It was a way to honor my family.
I had not even been thinking about making
a film about that subject.
But I felt inspired by my family history.
Do you think you will ever stop making films?
I had actually been considering retirement.
But an agent recently sent me a great script
that I couldn't turn down.
Well, that's good news for me and all of your fans.
