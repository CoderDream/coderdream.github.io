Oh no, the printer's jammed! My boss needs these documents for the meeting in ten minutes!
Don't worry, Amy. Let me take a look. Sometimes these machines just need a little coaxing.
Alright, I think I've got it. Let's give it a try.
Oh, thank goodness. You're a lifesaver, Mike. I don't know what I would have done without your help.
No problem at all. We're a team, right? Happy to lend a hand.
Seriously though, you really went above and beyond. I owe you big time.
Hey, it's all part of the job. Plus, I've been in your shoes before. Everyone needs a helping hand now and then.
Still, I really appreciate it. You're a gem, Mike.
Thanks, Amy. But you know, you're no slouch yourself. Your dedication and work ethic are truly admirable.
And your positive attitude, it's really infectious.
Oh Mike, you're making me flush.
I mean it. You're a real asset to the team.
Wow. Thank you. That means a lot. I guess we can make a pretty good team.
Absolutely. With your skills and my printer fixing abilities, there's nothing we can't handle.
