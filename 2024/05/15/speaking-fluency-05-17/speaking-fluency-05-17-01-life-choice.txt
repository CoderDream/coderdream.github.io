翻译，一句英文一句中文：
Karen: Oh my, isn't that your sister?
Joshua: Yeah, that's Cora.
Karen: I had no idea that her career is going so well. Why didn't you say anything?
Joshua: Well, we haven't talked about her much since she left her family and went to LA three years ago.
Karen: It sounds like you don't approve.
Joshua: Fanny was only ten years old and little Jeremy was still in kindergarten when she made that decision. She's supposed to look after the welfare of her children, but she just up and left.
Karen: Joshua, that's so unfair. You shouldn't judge people for chasing their dreams. Cora didn't abandon her family. She just needed to focus more on her career. Plus, I'm sure that she spends time with her kids whenever possible.
Joshua: Alright, maybe I'm being too harsh, but I still find her actions hard to understand.
Karen: Don't you think it would be a lot easier to lead a stable and comfortable life?
Joshua: Why chase such an unrealistic dream?
Karen: People are entitled to choose whatever is best for themselves. Besides, without risk, there's no reward. Look at her now. Her dream doesn't seem so unrealistic anymore, does it?
Joshua: Maybe.
Karen: I believe Cora fully understood the difficulty she'd face when she left for LA. I admire her strength to succeed under so much pressure.
Joshua: I know. I guess I'm just slightly jealous of her.
Karen: Only slightly?
