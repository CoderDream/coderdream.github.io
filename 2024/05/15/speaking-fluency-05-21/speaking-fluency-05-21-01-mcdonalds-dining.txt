Gosh, I don't think I'll ever get tired of looking at the scenery around here.
The southwest is stunning!
It certainly is.
By this time next year, I'll be writing my own travel book.
For inspiration, I'm going to record everything I see and experience during this trip.
Cool!
And I'll be your first reader!
I'm feeling kind of hungry though.
Are you hungry?
Yes, I'm starving.
I didn't realize that it's lunchtime already.
Let's find a place to stop.
What do you want to eat?
How about McDonald's?
There's one at the next exit.
That's fine with me.
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.
What can I get for you today?
Hi, I'd like a cheeseburger.
Sure, do you want a combination meal or just a cheeseburger?
A combination meal.
Okay, what would you like to drink with that?
A large iced tea.
A large iced tea.
Got it.
Anything else?
I'd also like a Big Mac and a medium Coke.
Okay, will you be eating here?
Yes, for here.
Okay, your total is $13.26.
Here you go.
Thank you, sir.
Your change is $6.74.
Your food should be up in a few minutes.
Thank you.
