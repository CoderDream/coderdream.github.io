Yes, I'm starving.
I didn't realize that it's lunchtime already.
Let's find a place to stop.
What do you want to eat?
How about McDonald's?
There's one at the next exit.
That's fine with me.
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.
What can I get for you today?
Hi, I'd like a cheeseburger.
Sure. Do you want a combination meal or just a cheeseburger?
A combination meal.
Okay. What would you like to drink with that?
A large iced tea.
A large iced tea. Got it.
Anything else?
I'd also like a Big Mac and a medium Coke.
Okay. Will you be eating here?
Yes, for here.
Okay. Your total is $13.26.
Here you go.
Thank you, sir. Your change is $6.74.
Your food should be up in a few minutes.
Thank you.
