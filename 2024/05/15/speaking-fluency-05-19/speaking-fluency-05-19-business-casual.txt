Uh-huh. Yes. Thank you very much. I look forward to it too.
Who was that?
That was Peter from the architecture firm. He offered me the position and I accepted it.
You did? That's great, Mindy. I'm so happy for you. When do you start?
HR asked me to come in on Monday, so I think I will find out the official start date then.
So tell me more about the company. What is the company culture like?
Well, from what I could observe during the interview, it's a small office and team at the present time.
The dress code is business casual. Speaking of which, I need to go shopping to expand my work wardrobe.
Want to come along?
Sure. Let me grab my bag. Do you want to walk or take the bus?
Hmm. If the bus is running late, it is going to take us a long time to get there. Let's walk. It will be faster.
What do you think of this shirt?
I like it, but don't you think it's too casual?
Yeah, you're probably right.
Why don't you look for a suit instead? Then you could wear it together or as separate pieces.
That's a great idea. I like this one over here. What do you think?
That's really nice. I like that color combination.
Okay. I will try it on.
Let me know how it looks.
