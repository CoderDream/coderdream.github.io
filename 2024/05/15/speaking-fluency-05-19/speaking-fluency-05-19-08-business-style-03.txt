Well everyone, it's a new year and there are going to be some changes around here.
At my former company, we had a strict dress code.
And as you know, I like to see my employees looking sharp.
That said, my present team of advisors tells me that I need to relax.
They showed me an article about current trends in today's major companies.
So this year, I'll allow you to dress business casual every day.
Our future plan is to let you wear anything you want on Fridays.
But whatever you wear, just make sure it isn't wrinkled, okay?
