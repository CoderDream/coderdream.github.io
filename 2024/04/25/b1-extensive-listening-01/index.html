<h4 id="English"><a href="#English" class="headerlink" title="English"></a>English</h4><blockquote>
<p>My story starts in Moscow.I was 15 years old.<br>My best friend and I, we were part of a group of Westerners,visiting the Soviet Union.This was in 1987,a few years before the fall of the communist regime.<br>We were given an official tour guide who was assigned to us.<br>And the tour would start in the morning,and we were checked in to our hotel rooms for the night.<br>My friend said to me, ‘’Let’s go outside and look at the city.’’<br>I thought it was a great idea.<br>Dumb idea.<br>So we grabbed our coats, and we snuck out past security and into the street.<br>We found the entrance to the metro.<br>The Moscow underground transportation system is the deepest one in the world.<br>The ride down the escalator took a full minute.<br>Once we were down there, my friend headed right to an open train,and I pulled him back and said, ‘Wait!<br>Let’s write down the name of the station so we can find our way back.’So I had a notepad, and I took a notepad,and I wrote down the letters of the station,and we hopped down the train and went on train hopping.<br>And that was fun because -Well, actually, it was weird.<br>There were a lot of people, probably all coming home from work.<br>They were all dressed in brown and gray clothes,and it looked very, very different from what we were used to at home.<br>But the stations were lovely.<br>There were stations with statues, with paintings on the wall,and glass displays.<br>It was really like museums.<br>We would never have expected that.<br>And everything was perfectly clean.<br>Well,what was weird though is that the people - nobody seemed to speak,and everyone seemed to be looking at us and it kind of weirded us out.<br>So after about 20-30 minutes,we’d had enough and we wanted to go home.<br>I showed my note to someone and they directed me over there.<br>Then over there, I showed my note to another person,and they directed us to the other way.<br>And then a third person directed us sideways.<br>That was a little confusing.<br>Aw, then I saw it.<br>Over the stairs, the sign.<br>It turned out I had written down the Russian word for ‘Exit.’So we headed upstairs and we found a taxi.<br>That was great.<br>And we told the driver, you know, ‘Intourist Hotel,’and then he was willing to take us.<br>And I remember sitting next to the driver, handing him 50 rubles.<br>And he looked at me and he said,(Russian) No, dollar!<br>Fifty dollars?<br>That was like I don’t know 20 times that amount or something.<br>That was not an option for us.<br>So we had to get out of the taxi,and he drove away, leaving us standing there.<br>It was a cold night,and you know everything was strange for us,and we were teenagers,and we were pretty nervous, didn’t know what to do.<br>Well, we started walking.<br>We walked to the end of the block.<br>We turned the corner.<br>And 200 yards in front of us, the Intourist Hotel.Well, this experience affected me in two ways.<br>The first is that anytime after this trip that I would hear anyone speak Russian,I was just cringe.<br>And the second one is that it taught me the importanceof understanding the local language when you’re traveling.<br>And it actually led to me learning another four languages fluentlyover the following years.<br>Now, before I go on, I’d like to know in the audience -Can we have a little bit of light maybe in the audience?<br>I’d just like to know who’s -By a show of hands, who is not a native English speaker?<br>It must be 99%.<br>Anyone who doesn’t speak English, stand up!<br>Alright, so I can assumeall of you have, you know, gone through the process of learning a language.<br>Anybody who speaks three or more languages?<br>Wow, that’s maybe 70%.<br>Four or more languages, anyone?<br>That’s still quite a bit.<br>Anyone speak five or more languages?<br>Wow, come see me during the break.<br>To me, learning a language is…<br>For me, it’s like a deck of playing cards lying faced down on the table.<br>As you start learning and understanding, the cards start opening up for you.<br>Now there’s no standard way of classifying this.<br>But as you learn, you reach certain milestones.<br>And the first one would be when about 25% of the cards are turned up,you reach like a basic level.<br>At this level, you have a base vocabulary, some grammar,and you’re able to have maybe very simple conversationsand communicate a little bit.<br>And your study goes on until you reach this magical point of fluency,what we call being fluent in the language.<br>Now what does it mean, being fluent in a language?<br>It means that you’ve turned up more than 50% of the cards in the deck,and that is the point where you have -where the language becomes part of your subconsciousso that even if you don’t use it anymore for 10 years or longer,you will not forget it.<br>You can get back into it within a very, very short time.<br>So this is a level where you’re comfortable thinking in a language,and comfortable communicating in a language.<br>Now, some people go on and, you know, reach like a mastery level.<br>By that time, you know classic literature in the other languageand have maybe in-depth knowledge of specialized fields.<br>That’s often the point taken in academia.<br>For me, when I learned my first foreign language,I had a head startbecause I was born to a German-speaking mother and an American father.<br>Now, when I was a baby, I didn’t really understandthat what my parents were speaking to me were two separate languages.<br>But by the time I was two years old, I had figured it all out.<br>Women speak only German.Men only speak English.Imagine the fun my parents had when they introduced me to couples.<br>Being a bilingual was actually pretty helpful in learning my first language.<br>It definitely helped.<br>If you’re -But it also gave me something else.<br>It gave me two identities and the ability to switch between them.<br>When you’re a native speaker of more than one language,then your personality, your humor, your value system,they change as you switch languages.<br>This can have huge advantages.<br>I mean, some studies have shown an increased problem-solving abilityor even a higher resistance to Alzheimer’s disease.<br>But what I’m almost interested inis that it’s actually given me a lot of social benefits.<br>When you’re a native speaker,then you feel at home among native speakers or in a culture,and also native speakers accept you as one of theirs.<br>Now is this only relevant to native speakers?<br>And that’s the big question.<br>But wouldn’t it be coolif a person learning a foreign language could actually develop another identityand actually enjoy the social benefits of a native speakerthat go beyond communication skills?<br>Well, that’s what happened to me.<br>I was able to do that,and I want to show you from my experience how I think this can be achieved.<br>So if we say this green area here is the level of the native speaker,the first thing to note is that on your way to reaching fluency,there is not really any shortcut.<br>There are some methods that you can use such as the Burrito Principlewhere you identify 20% of the most effective materials to study.<br>There are some apps, like stuff for time-spaced learning,that increase vocabulary retention.<br>They save a little time,but in the end, there’s no way around working with the material, practicing it,until you reach the fluency level.<br>But the second thing to noteis that going from fluency to mastery is a much slower process,and it requires proportionally more effort.<br>That’s why most people - they just stop at fluency.<br>They know how to speak English, good enough,and they don’t even attempt to venture on,and I can understand it.<br>But the good news is,to get the benefits of a native speaker, at a native-speaker level,you don’t have to go through mastery in the academic sense.<br>In fact, you can skip this step altogether.<br>So if you think about it,there are many native speakers do not have an in-depth knowledgeof specialized fields or sophisticated vocabulary.<br>So, that’s not really what is required.<br>So how do you do it?<br>What is required?<br>Well,I want to give you three areas to focus onwhen you’re learning and interacting with native speakers.<br>The first is: work on eliminating your accent.<br>I’m aware I said eliminating.<br>It should be at least minimizing it.<br>This is, in my opinion, the most overlooked aspectof language learning today,but it’s also the most important oneto reach what I call a native-speaker level or a speaker-like level.<br>If you communicate without an accent or almost without an accent,this changes how natives behave towards you unconsciously,and it also gives you an ability to adapt to a new self-image.<br>The best way that I’ve found -the best exercise I’ve found to improve your pronunciationis what I call the perfect-sentence technique.<br>What you do is you find a native speaker to help you,and you take a book in the foreign language,you open it at a random page,and you read the first sentence.<br>Then, you ask a native speaker to rate youon obvious accent, slight accent, no accent.<br>Then the native speaker will read this sentence back to you.<br>You have to listen carefully and then you repeat.<br>And you repeat this process over and over until the native speaker tells youthat he can no longer hear an accent when you read the sentence.<br>Now, I realize it can take a very long timeeven just to get one sentence right.<br>But I promise youif you are persistent, and if you patiently work on this,you’ll be amazed by what happens to your accent.<br>The second area to focus on is using verbs and expressions that locals use.<br>Now, we all know the situation that vocabulary can be region-specific.<br>Like, in the US, you use ‘stand in line.’In the UK, you ‘queue.’That’s all good.<br>But sometimes, the spoken word is so different,the speech is so different from what you get in textbooks,that the books are almost useless if you want to converse with natives.<br>I want to give you an example.<br>In the French language, there are words like ‘le travail,’which is ‘my work.’A French person talking to his friend would probably say ‘mon boulot,’which is a completely different word.<br>The same for ‘the clothes,’ ‘le vestments,’but you’ll hear ‘le fringues.’Or money is ‘l’argent,’but people say ‘le fric,’ ‘le sou,’ or many other expressions for this.<br>So, obviously I’m only scratching the surface here.<br>But here you actually have to learn all of these words and expressions one by one.<br>And of course, you have to interact with natives to do that.<br>But after you reach a critical mass that you’re comfortable with,it’ll actually be easier when you encounter something new.<br>You’ll just pick it up in one go, like native speakers would,who hear words or expressions that they didn’t know before.<br>The third area to work on is adopting cultural traits.<br>What do I mean by that?<br>So let me ask you:what does this gesture mean to you?<br>Any Italians here?<br>OK, now, depending on what culture you’re from,this could mean something rude,or it could just mean it’s something incredulous,like, ‘Why did you do that?’<br>Or, ‘How could you?’<br>Or it could just be signaling food, ‘Give me food!’<br>Interesting!<br>In the Middle East,this is just a standard way of signaling ‘Please, wait!’<br>So these kind of traits you have to internalize,and sometimes, they’re hard to spot,and it takes a lot of active listening.<br>I want to give you a few more examples.<br>So imagine I am with three of my friends: an American, a German, and a Frenchman.And, like, we’re walking and maybe the American bumps his head,and his initial reaction might be, ‘Ouch!’<br>That’s how you say it in English.But the German that, you know, gets, I don’t know, elbowed in the crowd,he would say, ‘Ow-ah!’<br>And the French person might step on the nail and say, ‘Ay!’<br>So this, of course, in your target language,this is something you have to observe and also internalize,and it has to become part of you.<br>If…<br>Again I’m with these three friends, and I sit with them,and let’s say I serve them tea,and I ask the American, ‘Would you like a biscuit with your tea?’<br>And if he answers in the affirmative, he might say, ‘Uh-huh!’<br>And I can ask the German, ‘Do you know what tea this is?’<br>He’ll say, ‘’Mm- hmm!’’<br>And then I ask the Frenchman, ‘Do you like this?’<br>He’ll say, ‘Hmm!’So these difference, they really require active listening.<br>So all of these three things that I told youwhich is pronunciation,and colloquial speech and adopting cultural traits,they all require that you interact with natives as much as possible.<br>Ideally, you should fully immerse yourself in the culture.<br>Now if you have the chance to live abroad for a while, that will be great.<br>Or maybe live among natives in your hometown.<br>Perhaps just have a romantic relationship,or even just spend time, you know, with co-workers.<br>So, romantic relationships, I could do a whole talk about that.<br>That works really well for these things.<br>But yeah -So this will be different for everybody, of course.<br>But even when you’re not around natives, your learning must not stop.<br>Because what you can do is you can watch TV shows and films,you can mimic the characters,you can write down anything that you haven’t heard of before,and practice that.<br>I also want to encourage you to learn the lyrics of songs.<br>Songs are really great because they tell stories.<br>And they not only help your pronunciation when you sing them,but if they’re emotional,they can anchor these expressions into your active vocabulary.<br>And it’s like speaking all day and really using the expressions unconsciously.<br>It’s a great way.<br>So music, definitely.<br>The other thing you need to move towards native-speaker statusis the right mindset,and a belief that if you sound like a native,express yourself like a native,talk like a native and act like a native,you’ll actually achieve a native-like level.<br>So if I could only leave you with one thing today,it would be: work on your pronunciation.<br>Because pronunciationhelps any stage of the learning process,even in the very beginning.<br>It’ll speed up everything.<br>And it also is the key to reaching a native-speaker level,or almost-native-speaker status.<br>So before I go,I’d like to tell you how I was able to overcome my fear of the Russian language.<br>It was a very, very elegant solution.<br>I married a Russian girl.<br>And I now have little kids in my home that speak Russian to me every day.<br>So I want to thank you.<br>(Applause)<br>And before I go, I just want to wish you(Spanish) A lot of success with your language studies.<br>(French)<br>It was a pleasure to present for you today.<br>(Hebrew)<br>I wish you lots of success with your studies.<br>(Yiddish)<br>Thank you for listening.<br>Good luck to you all and…<br>(Russian)<br>Thank you.<br>(Applause)</p>

<p>My story starts in Moscow.I was 15 years old.<br>我的故事从莫斯科开始，当时我15岁。</p>
<p>My best friend and I, we were part of a group of Westerners,visiting the Soviet Union.This was in 1987,a few years before the fall of the communist regime.<br>我和我最好的朋友，我们是一群西方人的一部分，访问苏联，那是在1987年，共产主义政权垮台前几年。</p>
<p>We were given an official tour guide who was assigned to us.<br>我们得到了一位分配给我们的官方导游。</p>
<p>And the tour would start in the morning,and we were checked in to our hotel rooms for the night.<br>旅行将在早上开始，我们被登记入住了我们的酒店房间过夜。</p>
<p>My friend said to me, ‘’Let’s go outside and look at the city.’’<br>我的朋友对我说，’我们到外面去看看这个城市吧。</p>
<p>I thought it was a great idea.<br>我认为这是个好主意。</p>
<p>Dumb idea.<br>愚蠢的想法。</p>
<p>So we grabbed our coats, and we snuck out past security and into the street.<br>于是，我们拿起外套，偷偷溜出安检，走到街上。</p>
<p>We found the entrance to the metro.<br>我们找到了地铁的入口。</p>
<p>The Moscow underground transportation system is the deepest one in the world.<br>莫斯科的地下交通系统是世界上最深的地下交通系统。</p>
<p>The ride down the escalator took a full minute.<br>乘坐自动扶梯花了整整一分钟。</p>
<p>Once we were down there, my friend headed right to an open train,and I pulled him back and said, ‘Wait!<br>我们一到那里，我的朋友就直奔一辆敞篷火车，我把他拉回来，说，’等等！</p>
<p>Let’s write down the name of the station so we can find our way back.’So I had a notepad, and I took a notepad,and I wrote down the letters of the station,and we hopped down the train and went on train hopping.<br>于是我拿了一个记事本，拿了一个记事本，写下了车站的字母，然后我们跳下火车，继续跳火车。</p>
<p>And that was fun because -Well, actually, it was weird.<br>这很有趣，因为——嗯，实际上，这很奇怪。</p>
<p>There were a lot of people, probably all coming home from work.<br>有很多人，可能都下班回家了。</p>
<p>They were all dressed in brown and gray clothes,and it looked very, very different from what we were used to at home.<br>他们都穿着棕色和灰色的衣服，看起来和我们在家里习惯的衣服非常非常不同。</p>
<p>But the stations were lovely.<br>但是车站很可爱。</p>
<p>There were stations with statues, with paintings on the wall,and glass displays.<br>有雕像的车站，墙上有画，还有玻璃展示。</p>
<p>It was really like museums.<br>这真的像博物馆。</p>
<p>We would never have expected that.<br>我们从未预料到这一点。</p>
<p>And everything was perfectly clean.<br>一切都很干净。</p>
<p>Well,what was weird though is that the people - nobody seemed to speak,and everyone seemed to be looking at us and it kind of weirded us out.<br>好吧，奇怪的是，人们似乎没有人说话，每个人似乎都在看着我们，这让我们有点奇怪。</p>
<p>So after about 20-30 minutes,we’d had enough and we wanted to go home.<br>所以大约20-30分钟后，我们受够了，我们想回家。</p>
<p>I showed my note to someone and they directed me over there.<br>我把我的纸条给别人看，他们把我带到了那里。</p>
<p>Then over there, I showed my note to another person,and they directed us to the other way.<br>然后在那里，我把我的纸条给另一个人看，他们把我们引向另一条路。</p>
<p>And then a third person directed us sideways.<br>然后第三个人把我们引向一边。</p>
<p>That was a little confusing.<br>这有点令人困惑。</p>
<p>Aw, then I saw it.<br>噢，然后我看到了。</p>
<p>Over the stairs, the sign.<br>在楼梯上，标志。</p>
<p>It turned out I had written down the Russian word for ‘Exit.’So we headed upstairs and we found a taxi.<br>原来我写下了俄语中的“退出”一词，于是我们上楼，找到了一辆出租车。</p>
<p>That was great.<br>那太好了。</p>
<p>And we told the driver, you know, ‘Intourist Hotel,’and then he was willing to take us.<br>我们告诉司机，你知道，’Intourist Hotel’，然后他愿意带我们去。</p>
<p>And I remember sitting next to the driver, handing him 50 rubles.<br>我记得坐在司机旁边，递给他 50 卢布。</p>
<p>And he looked at me and he said,(Russian) No, dollar!<br>他看着我说，（俄语）不，美元！</p>
<p>Fifty dollars?<br>五十美元？</p>
<p>That was like I don’t know 20 times that amount or something.<br>这就像我不知道 20 倍的数量或其他什么。</p>
<p>That was not an option for us.<br>这对我们来说不是一个选择。</p>
<p>So we had to get out of the taxi,and he drove away, leaving us standing there.<br>所以我们不得不下车，他开车走了，留下我们站在那里。</p>
<p>It was a cold night,and you know everything was strange for us,and we were teenagers,and we were pretty nervous, didn’t know what to do.<br>那是一个寒冷的夜晚，你知道对我们来说一切都很奇怪，我们是十几岁的孩子，我们很紧张，不知道该怎么办。</p>
<p>Well, we started walking.<br>好吧，我们开始走路。</p>
<p>We walked to the end of the block.<br>我们走到街区的尽头。</p>
<p>We turned the corner.<br>我们转过了拐角。</p>
<p>And 200 yards in front of us, the Intourist Hotel.Well, this experience affected me in two ways.<br>在我们前面200码处，Intourist Hotel.嗯，这次经历在两个方面影响了我。</p>
<p>The first is that anytime after this trip that I would hear anyone speak Russian,I was just cringe.<br>首先，在这次旅行之后的任何时候，我都会听到有人说俄语，我只是畏缩。</p>
<p>And the second one is that it taught me the importanceof understanding the local language when you’re traveling.<br>第二个是它教会了我在旅行时了解当地语言的重要性。</p>
<p>And it actually led to me learning another four languages fluentlyover the following years.<br>在接下来的几年里，它实际上使我流利地学习了另外四种语言。</p>
<p>Now, before I go on, I’d like to know in the audience -Can we have a little bit of light maybe in the audience?<br>现在，在我继续之前，我想知道观众席上——我们能不能在观众席上有一点光？</p>
<p>I’d just like to know who’s -By a show of hands, who is not a native English speaker?<br>我只想知道谁是 - 通过举手，谁不是以英语为母语的人？</p>
<p>It must be 99%.<br>它必须是 99%。</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn’t speak English, stand up!<br>任何不会说英语的人，请站起来！</p>
<p>Alright, so I can assumeall of you have, you know, gone through the process of learning a language.<br>好吧，我可以假设你们所有人都经历过学习语言的过程。</p>
<p>Anybody who speaks three or more languages?<br>有人会说三种或三种以上的语言吗？</p>
<p>Wow, that’s maybe 70%.<br>哇，大概是70%。</p>
<p>Four or more languages, anyone?<br>四种或更多语言，有人吗？</p>
<p>That’s still quite a bit.<br>这还是相当多的。</p>
<p>Anyone speak five or more languages?<br>有人会说五种或更多语言吗？</p>
<p>Wow, come see me during the break.<br>哇，休息时间来看我。</p>
<p>To me, learning a language is…<br>对我来说，学习一门语言是……</p>
<p>For me, it’s like a deck of playing cards lying faced down on the table.<br>对我来说，这就像一副扑克牌面朝下躺在桌子上。</p>
<p>As you start learning and understanding, the cards start opening up for you.<br>当你开始学习和理解时，卡片开始为你打开。</p>
<p>Now there’s no standard way of classifying this.<br>现在没有标准的分类方法。</p>
<p>But as you learn, you reach certain milestones.<br>但随着你的学习，你会达到某些里程碑。</p>
<p>And the first one would be when about 25% of the cards are turned up,you reach like a basic level.<br>第一个是当大约 25% 的牌被打开时，你达到了一个基本水平。</p>
<p>At this level, you have a base vocabulary, some grammar,and you’re able to have maybe very simple conversationsand communicate a little bit.<br>在这个级别上，你有一个基本的词汇，一些语法，你能够进行非常简单的对话和交流。</p>
<p>And your study goes on until you reach this magical point of fluency,what we call being fluent in the language.<br>你的学习会继续下去，直到你达到这个神奇的流利程度，我们称之为流利的语言。</p>
<p>Now what does it mean, being fluent in a language?<br>那么，流利地使用一门语言意味着什么？</p>
<p>It means that you’ve turned up more than 50% of the cards in the deck,and that is the point where you have -where the language becomes part of your subconsciousso that even if you don’t use it anymore for 10 years or longer,you will not forget it.<br>这意味着你已经翻出了牌组中超过50%的牌，这就是你拥有的地方——语言成为你潜意识的一部分，所以即使你不再使用它10年或更长时间，你也不会忘记它。</p>
<p>You can get back into it within a very, very short time.<br>你可以在非常非常短的时间内重新进入它。</p>
<p>So this is a level where you’re comfortable thinking in a language,and comfortable communicating in a language.<br>所以在这个层面上，你可以自如地用一种语言思考，也自在地用一种语言进行交流。</p>
<p>Now, some people go on and, you know, reach like a mastery level.<br>现在，有些人继续前进，你知道，达到了精通的水平。</p>
<p>By that time, you know classic literature in the other languageand have maybe in-depth knowledge of specialized fields.<br>到那时，您已经了解了另一种语言的经典文学，并且可能对专业领域有深入的了解。</p>
<p>That’s often the point taken in academia.<br>这是学术界经常采取的观点。</p>
<p>For me, when I learned my first foreign language,I had a head startbecause I was born to a German-speaking mother and an American father.<br>对我来说，当我学习我的第一门外语时，我有一个良好的开端，因为我的母亲说德语，父亲是美国人。</p>
<p>Now, when I was a baby, I didn’t really understandthat what my parents were speaking to me were two separate languages.<br>现在，当我还是个婴儿的时候，我真的不明白我的父母对我说的是两种不同的语言。</p>
<p>But by the time I was two years old, I had figured it all out.<br>但到我两岁的时候，我已经想通了。</p>
<p>Women speak only German. Men only speak English. Imagine the fun my parents had when they introduced me to couples.<br>女人只会说德语，男人只会说英语，想象一下我父母把我介绍给情侣时的乐趣。</p>
<p>Being a bilingual was actually pretty helpful in learning my first language.<br>作为一个双语者实际上对学习我的第一语言非常有帮助。</p>
<p>It definitely helped.<br>这绝对有帮助。</p>
<p>If you’re -But it also gave me something else.<br>如果你是——但它也给了我别的东西。</p>
<p>It gave me two identities and the ability to switch between them.<br>它给了我两种身份，并能够在它们之间切换。</p>
<p>When you’re a native speaker of more than one language,then your personality, your humor, your value system,they change as you switch languages.<br>当你的母语是多种语言的人时，你的个性、你的幽默、你的价值体系，它们都会随着你切换语言而改变。</p>
<p>This can have huge advantages.<br>这可能具有巨大的优势。</p>
<p>I mean, some studies have shown an increased problem-solving abilityor even a higher resistance to Alzheimer’s disease.<br>我的意思是，一些研究表明，解决问题的能力有所提高，甚至对阿尔茨海默病的抵抗力更高。</p>
<p>But what I’m almost interested inis that it’s actually given me a lot of social benefits.<br>但我几乎感兴趣的是，它实际上给了我很多社会效益。</p>
<p>When you’re a native speaker,then you feel at home among native speakers or in a culture,and also native speakers accept you as one of theirs.<br>当你是母语人士时，你会在母语人士或一种文化中感到宾至如归，而且母语人士也接受你作为他们中的一员。</p>
<p>Now is this only relevant to native speakers?<br>现在，这是否仅与母语人士有关？</p>
<p>And that’s the big question.<br>这是个大问题。</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be coolif a person learning a foreign language could actually develop another identityand actually enjoy the social benefits of a native speakerthat go beyond communication skills?<br>但是，如果一个学习外语的人实际上可以发展出另一种身份，并真正享受母语人士的社会利益，那不是很酷吗？</p>
<p>Well, that’s what happened to me.<br>嗯，这就是发生在我身上的事情。</p>
<p>I was able to do that,and I want to show you from my experience how I think this can be achieved.<br>我能够做到这一点，我想从我的经验中向你展示我认为如何实现这一目标。</p>
<p>So if we say this green area here is the level of the native speaker,the first thing to note is that on your way to reaching fluency,there is not really any shortcut.<br>因此，如果我们说这里的绿色区域是母语人士的水平，首先要注意的是，在达到流利程度的道路上，实际上没有任何捷径。</p>
<p>There are some methods that you can use such as the Burrito Principlewhere you identify 20% of the most effective materials to study.<br>您可以使用一些方法，例如墨西哥卷饼原则，您可以确定 20% 的最有效材料进行研究。</p>
<p>There are some apps, like stuff for time-spaced learning,that increase vocabulary retention.<br>有一些应用程序，比如用于时间间隔学习的东西，可以增加词汇量的保留。</p>
<p>They save a little time,but in the end, there’s no way around working with the material, practicing it,until you reach the fluency level.<br>他们节省了一点时间，但最终，没有办法使用材料，练习它，直到你达到流利的水平。</p>
<p>But the second thing to noteis that going from fluency to mastery is a much slower process,and it requires proportionally more effort.<br>但第二件需要注意的事情是，从流利到精通是一个缓慢得多的过程，并且需要成比例地付出更多的努力。</p>
<p>That’s why most people - they just stop at fluency.<br>这就是为什么大多数人 - 他们只是停留在流利度上。</p>
<p>They know how to speak English, good enough,and they don’t even attempt to venture on,and I can understand it.<br>他们知道如何说英语，足够好，他们甚至不试图冒险，我能理解。</p>
<p>But the good news is,to get the benefits of a native speaker, at a native-speaker level,you don’t have to go through mastery in the academic sense.<br>但好消息是，要获得母语人士的好处，在母语人士的水平上，您不必经过学术意义上的精通。</p>
<p>In fact, you can skip this step altogether.<br>事实上，您可以完全跳过此步骤。</p>
<p>So if you think about it,there are many native speakers do not have an in-depth knowledgeof specialized fields or sophisticated vocabulary.<br>所以如果你仔细想想，有很多母语人士对专业领域或复杂的词汇没有深入的了解。</p>
<p>So, that’s not really what is required.<br>所以，这并不是真正需要的。</p>
<p>So how do you do it?<br>那么你是怎么做到的呢？</p>
<p>What is required?<br>需要什么？</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well,I want to give you three areas to focus onwhen you’re learning and interacting with native speakers.<br>好吧，我想给你三个方面，当你学习和与母语人士互动时。</p>
<p>The first is: work on eliminating your accent.<br>首先是：努力消除你的口音。</p>
<p>I’m aware I said eliminating.<br>我知道我说过消除。</p>
<p>It should be at least minimizing it.<br>它至少应该最小化它。</p>
<p>This is, in my opinion, the most overlooked aspectof language learning today,but it’s also the most important oneto reach what I call a native-speaker level or a speaker-like level.<br>在我看来，这是当今语言学习中最容易被忽视的方面，但也是达到我所说的母语水平或类似说话者水平的最重要的方面。</p>
<p>If you communicate without an accent or almost without an accent,this changes how natives behave towards you unconsciously,and it also gives you an ability to adapt to a new self-image.<br>如果你没有口音或几乎没有口音地交流，这会无意识地改变当地人对你的行为方式，也让你有能力适应新的自我形象。</p>
<p>The best way that I’ve found -the best exercise I’ve found to improve your pronunciationis what I call the perfect-sentence technique.<br>我发现的最好的方法 - 我发现的改善发音的最佳练习是我所说的完美句子技巧。</p>
<p>What you do is you find a native speaker to help you,and you take a book in the foreign language,you open it at a random page,and you read the first sentence.<br>你要做的是找一个母语人士来帮助你，然后你拿一本外语的书，你随便翻开一页，然后读第一句话。</p>
<p>Then, you ask a native speaker to rate youon obvious accent, slight accent, no accent.<br>然后，你让一个母语人士对你的明显口音、轻微口音、无口音进行评分。</p>
<p>Then the native speaker will read this sentence back to you.<br>然后母语人士会把这句话读给你听。</p>
<p>You have to listen carefully and then you repeat.<br>你必须仔细听，然后重复。</p>
<p>And you repeat this process over and over until the native speaker tells youthat he can no longer hear an accent when you read the sentence.<br>你一遍又一遍地重复这个过程，直到母语人士告诉你，当你读这句话时，他再也听不到口音了。</p>
<p>Now, I realize it can take a very long timeeven just to get one sentence right.<br>现在，我意识到即使只是把一句话说对，也可能需要很长时间。</p>
<p>But I promise youif you are persistent, and if you patiently work on this,you’ll be amazed by what happens to your accent.<br>但我向你保证，如果你坚持不懈，如果你耐心地努力，你会惊讶于你的口音会发生什么。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second area to focus on is using verbs and expressions that locals use.<br>第二个需要关注的领域是使用当地人使用的动词和表达方式。</p>
<p>Now, we all know the situation that vocabulary can be region-specific.<br>现在，我们都知道词汇可以是特定于区域的情况。</p>
<p>Like, in the US, you use ‘stand in line.’In the UK, you ‘queue.’That’s all good.<br>比如，在美国，你用的是“排队”，在英国，你是“排队”，这都很好。</p>
<p>But sometimes, the spoken word is so different,the speech is so different from what you get in textbooks,that the books are almost useless if you want to converse with natives.<br>但有时，口语是如此不同，语音与你在教科书上得到的如此不同，如果你想与当地人交谈，这些书几乎毫无用处。</p>
<p>I want to give you an example.<br>我想给你举个例子。</p>
<p>In the French language, there are words like ‘le travail,’which is ‘my work.’A French person talking to his friend would probably say ‘mon boulot,’which is a completely different word.<br>在法语中，有像“le travail”这样的词，这是“我的工作”，一个法国人与他的朋友交谈时可能会说“mon boulot”，这是一个完全不同的词。</p>
<p>The same for ‘the clothes,’ ‘le vestments,’but you’ll hear ‘le fringues.’Or money is ‘l’argent,’but people say ‘le fric,’ ‘le sou,’ or many other expressions for this.<br>“衣服”、“法衣”也是如此，但你会听到“le fringues”，或者钱是“l’argent”，但人们会说“le fric”、“le sou”或许多其他表达方式。</p>
<p>So, obviously I’m only scratching the surface here.<br>所以，显然我只是在这里触及了表面。</p>
<p>But here you actually have to learn all of these words and expressions one by one.<br>但在这里，你实际上必须一个接一个地学习所有这些单词和表达方式。</p>
<p>And of course, you have to interact with natives to do that.<br>当然，你必须与当地人互动才能做到这一点。</p>
<p>But after you reach a critical mass that you’re comfortable with,it’ll actually be easier when you encounter something new.<br>但是在你达到一个你觉得舒服的临界质量之后，当你遇到新事物时，它实际上会更容易。</p>
<p>You’ll just pick it up in one go, like native speakers would,who hear words or expressions that they didn’t know before.<br>你只需一口气拿起它，就像母语人士一样，他们会听到他们以前不知道的单词或表达方式。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The third area to work on is adopting cultural traits.<br>第三个工作领域是采用文化特征。</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?<br>我这是什么意思？</p>
<p>So let me ask you:what does this gesture mean to you?<br>那么让我问你：这个姿态对你来说意味着什么？</p>
<p>Any Italians here?<br>这里有意大利人吗？</p>
<p>OK, now, depending on what culture you’re from,this could mean something rude,or it could just mean it’s something incredulous,like, ‘Why did you do that?’<br>好吧，现在，根据你来自什么文化，这可能意味着一些粗鲁的事情，或者它可能只是意味着一些难以置信的事情，比如，“你为什么要这样做？</p>
<p>Or, ‘How could you?’<br>“或者，”你怎么能？</p>
<p>Or it could just be signaling food, ‘Give me food!’<br>或者它可能只是在向食物发出信号，“给我食物！</p>
<p>Interesting!<br>有趣！</p>
<p>In the Middle East,this is just a standard way of signaling ‘Please, wait!’<br>在中东，这只是一种标准的信号方式，“请稍等！</p>
<p>So these kind of traits you have to internalize,and sometimes, they’re hard to spot,and it takes a lot of active listening.<br>所以这些特质你必须内化，有时，它们很难被发现，这需要大量的积极倾听。</p>
<p>I want to give you a few more examples.<br>我想再举几个例子。</p>
<p>So imagine I am with three of my friends: an American, a German, and a Frenchman.And, like, we’re walking and maybe the American bumps his head,and his initial reaction might be, ‘Ouch!’<br>想象一下，我和我的三个朋友在一起：一个美国人，一个德国人，一个法国人。</p>
<p>That’s how you say it in English.But the German that, you know, gets, I don’t know, elbowed in the crowd,he would say, ‘Ow-ah!’<br>但是，你知道，德国人，我不知道，在人群中肘击，他会说，’噢，啊！</p>
<p>And the French person might step on the nail and say, ‘Ay!’<br>法国人可能会踩到钉子说，’哎呀！</p>
<p>So this, of course, in your target language,this is something you have to observe and also internalize,and it has to become part of you.<br>所以，当然，在你的目标语言中，这是你必须观察和内化的东西，它必须成为你的一部分。</p>
<p>If…<br>如果。。。</p>
<p>Again I’m with these three friends, and I sit with them,and let’s say I serve them tea,and I ask the American, ‘Would you like a biscuit with your tea?’<br>我又一次和这三个朋友在一起，我和他们坐在一起，假设我给他们端茶，我问美国人，“你想在茶里吃饼干吗？</p>
<p>And if he answers in the affirmative, he might say, ‘Uh-huh!’<br>如果他的回答是肯定的，他可能会说，“嗯！</p>
<p>And I can ask the German, ‘Do you know what tea this is?’<br>我可以问德国人，’你知道这是什么茶吗？</p>
<p>He’ll say, ‘’Mm- hmm!’’<br>他会说，’嗯——嗯！</p>
<p>And then I ask the Frenchman, ‘Do you like this?’<br>然后我问法国人，’你喜欢这个吗？</p>
<p>He’ll say, ‘Hmm!’So these difference, they really require active listening.<br>他会说，’嗯！’所以这些差异，它们真的需要积极倾听。</p>
<p>So all of these three things that I told youwhich is pronunciation,and colloquial speech and adopting cultural traits,they all require that you interact with natives as much as possible.<br>所以我告诉你的这三件事，即发音、口语和采用文化特征，它们都要求你尽可能多地与当地人互动。</p>
<p>Ideally, you should fully immerse yourself in the culture.<br>理想情况下，您应该完全沉浸在文化中。</p>
<p>Now if you have the chance to live abroad for a while, that will be great.<br>现在，如果您有机会在国外生活一段时间，那就太好了。</p>
<p>Or maybe live among natives in your hometown.<br>或者也许住在你家乡的当地人中间。</p>
<p>Perhaps just have a romantic relationship,or even just spend time, you know, with co-workers.<br>也许只是有一段浪漫的关系，甚至只是花时间，你知道，和同事在一起。</p>
<p>So, romantic relationships, I could do a whole talk about that.<br>所以，恋爱关系，我可以做一个完整的讨论。</p>
<p>That works really well for these things.<br>这对于这些事情非常有效。</p>
<p>But yeah -So this will be different for everybody, of course.<br>但是，是的 - 所以当然，这对每个人来说都是不同的。</p>
<p>But even when you’re not around natives, your learning must not stop.<br>但即使你不在当地人身边，你的学习也不能停止。</p>
<p>Because what you can do is you can watch TV shows and films,you can mimic the characters,you can write down anything that you haven’t heard of before,and practice that.<br>因为你能做的就是看电视节目和电影，你可以模仿角色，你可以写下任何你以前没有听说过的东西，然后练习。</p>
<p>I also want to encourage you to learn the lyrics of songs.<br>我还想鼓励你学习歌曲的歌词。</p>
<p>Songs are really great because they tell stories.<br>歌曲真的很棒，因为它们会讲故事。</p>
<p>And they not only help your pronunciation when you sing them,but if they’re emotional,they can anchor these expressions into your active vocabulary.<br>当你唱歌时，它们不仅有助于你的发音，而且如果他们是情绪化的，它们可以将这些表达锚定到你的活跃词汇中。</p>
<p>And it’s like speaking all day and really using the expressions unconsciously.<br>这就像整天说话，真的在不知不觉中使用这些表达方式。</p>
<p>It’s a great way.<br>这是一个很好的方法。</p>
<p>So music, definitely.<br>所以音乐，绝对是。</p>
<p>The other thing you need to move towards native-speaker statusis the right mindset,and a belief that if you sound like a native,express yourself like a native,talk like a native and act like a native,you’ll actually achieve a native-like level.<br>迈向母语人士地位的另一件事是正确的心态，以及一种信念，即如果你听起来像母语，像母语一样表达自己，像母语一样说话，像母语一样行事，你实际上会达到类似母语的水平。</p>
<p>So if I could only leave you with one thing today,it would be: work on your pronunciation.<br>因此，如果我今天只能留给你一件事，那就是：努力提高你的发音。</p>
<p>Because pronunciationhelps any stage of the learning process,even in the very beginning.<br>因为发音有助于学习过程的任何阶段，即使是在一开始。</p>
<p>It’ll speed up everything.<br>它会加快一切。</p>
<p>And it also is the key to reaching a native-speaker level,or almost-native-speaker status.<br>这也是达到母语水平或几乎母语水平的关键。</p>
<p>So before I go,I’d like to tell you how I was able to overcome my fear of the Russian language.<br>所以在我走之前，我想告诉你我是如何克服对俄语的恐惧的。</p>
<p>It was a very, very elegant solution.<br>这是一个非常非常优雅的解决方案。</p>
<p>I married a Russian girl.<br>我娶了一个俄罗斯女孩。</p>
<p>And I now have little kids in my home that speak Russian to me every day.<br>我现在家里有小孩，他们每天都对我说俄语。</p>
<p>So I want to thank you.<br>所以我要感谢你。</p>
<p>(Applause)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>And before I go, I just want to wish you(Spanish) A lot of success with your language studies.<br>在我走之前，我只想祝你（西班牙语）在语言学习方面取得圆满成功。</p>
<p>(French)<br>（法语）</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to present for you today.<br>很高兴今天为大家介绍。</p>
<p>(Hebrew)<br>（希伯来语）</p>
<p>I wish you lots of success with your studies.<br>祝你在学业上取得圆满成功。</p>
<p>(Yiddish)<br>（意第绪语）</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.<br>感谢您的聆听。</p>
<p>Good luck to you all and…<br>祝大家好运……</p>
<p>(Russian)<br>（俄语）</p>
<p>Thank you.<br>谢谢。</p>
