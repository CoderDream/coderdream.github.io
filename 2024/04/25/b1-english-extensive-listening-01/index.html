<h4 id="English"><a href="#English" class="headerlink" title="English"></a>English</h4><blockquote>
<p>My story starts in Moscow.I was 15 years old.<br>My best friend and I, we were part of a group of Westerners,visiting the Soviet Union.This was in 1987,a few years before the fall of the communist regime.<br>We were given an official tour guide who was assigned to us.<br>And the tour would start in the morning,and we were checked in to our hotel rooms for the night.<br>My friend said to me, ‘’Let’s go outside and look at the city.’’<br>I thought it was a great idea.<br>Dumb idea.<br>So we grabbed our coats, and we snuck out past security and into the street.<br>We found the entrance to the metro.<br>The Moscow underground transportation system is the deepest one in the world.<br>The ride down the escalator took a full minute.<br>Once we were down there, my friend headed right to an open train,and I pulled him back and said, ‘Wait!<br>Let’s write down the name of the station so we can find our way back.’So I had a notepad, and I took a notepad,and I wrote down the letters of the station,and we hopped down the train and went on train hopping.<br>And that was fun because -Well, actually, it was weird.<br>There were a lot of people, probably all coming home from work.<br>They were all dressed in brown and gray clothes,and it looked very, very different from what we were used to at home.<br>But the stations were lovely.<br>There were stations with statues, with paintings on the wall,and glass displays.<br>It was really like museums.<br>We would never have expected that.<br>And everything was perfectly clean.<br>Well,what was weird though is that the people - nobody seemed to speak,and everyone seemed to be looking at us and it kind of weirded us out.<br>So after about 20-30 minutes,we’d had enough and we wanted to go home.<br>I showed my note to someone and they directed me over there.<br>Then over there, I showed my note to another person,and they directed us to the other way.<br>And then a third person directed us sideways.<br>That was a little confusing.<br>Aw, then I saw it.<br>Over the stairs, the sign.<br>It turned out I had written down the Russian word for ‘Exit.’So we headed upstairs and we found a taxi.<br>That was great.<br>And we told the driver, you know, ‘Intourist Hotel,’and then he was willing to take us.<br>And I remember sitting next to the driver, handing him 50 rubles.<br>And he looked at me and he said,(Russian) No, dollar!<br>Fifty dollars?<br>That was like I don’t know 20 times that amount or something.<br>That was not an option for us.<br>So we had to get out of the taxi,and he drove away, leaving us standing there.<br>It was a cold night,and you know everything was strange for us,and we were teenagers,and we were pretty nervous, didn’t know what to do.<br>Well, we started walking.<br>We walked to the end of the block.<br>We turned the corner.<br>And 200 yards in front of us, the Intourist Hotel.Well, this experience affected me in two ways.<br>The first is that anytime after this trip that I would hear anyone speak Russian,I was just cringe.<br>And the second one is that it taught me the importanceof understanding the local language when you’re traveling.<br>And it actually led to me learning another four languages fluentlyover the following years.<br>Now, before I go on, I’d like to know in the audience -Can we have a little bit of light maybe in the audience?<br>I’d just like to know who’s -By a show of hands, who is not a native English speaker?<br>It must be 99%.<br>Anyone who doesn’t speak English, stand up!<br>Alright, so I can assumeall of you have, you know, gone through the process of learning a language.<br>Anybody who speaks three or more languages?<br>Wow, that’s maybe 70%.<br>Four or more languages, anyone?<br>That’s still quite a bit.<br>Anyone speak five or more languages?<br>Wow, come see me during the break.<br>To me, learning a language is…<br>For me, it’s like a deck of playing cards lying faced down on the table.<br>As you start learning and understanding, the cards start opening up for you.<br>Now there’s no standard way of classifying this.<br>But as you learn, you reach certain milestones.<br>And the first one would be when about 25% of the cards are turned up,you reach like a basic level.<br>At this level, you have a base vocabulary, some grammar,and you’re able to have maybe very simple conversationsand communicate a little bit.<br>And your study goes on until you reach this magical point of fluency,what we call being fluent in the language.<br>Now what does it mean, being fluent in a language?<br>It means that you’ve turned up more than 50% of the cards in the deck,and that is the point where you have -where the language becomes part of your subconsciousso that even if you don’t use it anymore for 10 years or longer,you will not forget it.<br>You can get back into it within a very, very short time.<br>So this is a level where you’re comfortable thinking in a language,and comfortable communicating in a language.<br>Now, some people go on and, you know, reach like a mastery level.<br>By that time, you know classic literature in the other languageand have maybe in-depth knowledge of specialized fields.<br>That’s often the point taken in academia.<br>For me, when I learned my first foreign language,I had a head startbecause I was born to a German-speaking mother and an American father.<br>Now, when I was a baby, I didn’t really understandthat what my parents were speaking to me were two separate languages.<br>But by the time I was two years old, I had figured it all out.<br>Women speak only German.Men only speak English.Imagine the fun my parents had when they introduced me to couples.<br>Being a bilingual was actually pretty helpful in learning my first language.<br>It definitely helped.<br>If you’re -But it also gave me something else.<br>It gave me two identities and the ability to switch between them.<br>When you’re a native speaker of more than one language,then your personality, your humor, your value system,they change as you switch languages.<br>This can have huge advantages.<br>I mean, some studies have shown an increased problem-solving abilityor even a higher resistance to Alzheimer’s disease.<br>But what I’m almost interested inis that it’s actually given me a lot of social benefits.<br>When you’re a native speaker,then you feel at home among native speakers or in a culture,and also native speakers accept you as one of theirs.<br>Now is this only relevant to native speakers?<br>And that’s the big question.<br>But wouldn’t it be coolif a person learning a foreign language could actually develop another identityand actually enjoy the social benefits of a native speakerthat go beyond communication skills?<br>Well, that’s what happened to me.<br>I was able to do that,and I want to show you from my experience how I think this can be achieved.<br>So if we say this green area here is the level of the native speaker,the first thing to note is that on your way to reaching fluency,there is not really any shortcut.<br>There are some methods that you can use such as the Burrito Principlewhere you identify 20% of the most effective materials to study.<br>There are some apps, like stuff for time-spaced learning,that increase vocabulary retention.<br>They save a little time,but in the end, there’s no way around working with the material, practicing it,until you reach the fluency level.<br>But the second thing to noteis that going from fluency to mastery is a much slower process,and it requires proportionally more effort.<br>That’s why most people - they just stop at fluency.<br>They know how to speak English, good enough,and they don’t even attempt to venture on,and I can understand it.<br>But the good news is,to get the benefits of a native speaker, at a native-speaker level,you don’t have to go through mastery in the academic sense.<br>In fact, you can skip this step altogether.<br>So if you think about it,there are many native speakers do not have an in-depth knowledgeof specialized fields or sophisticated vocabulary.<br>So, that’s not really what is required.<br>So how do you do it?<br>What is required?<br>Well,I want to give you three areas to focus onwhen you’re learning and interacting with native speakers.<br>The first is: work on eliminating your accent.<br>I’m aware I said eliminating.<br>It should be at least minimizing it.<br>This is, in my opinion, the most overlooked aspectof language learning today,but it’s also the most important oneto reach what I call a native-speaker level or a speaker-like level.<br>If you communicate without an accent or almost without an accent,this changes how natives behave towards you unconsciously,and it also gives you an ability to adapt to a new self-image.<br>The best way that I’ve found -the best exercise I’ve found to improve your pronunciationis what I call the perfect-sentence technique.<br>What you do is you find a native speaker to help you,and you take a book in the foreign language,you open it at a random page,and you read the first sentence.<br>Then, you ask a native speaker to rate youon obvious accent, slight accent, no accent.<br>Then the native speaker will read this sentence back to you.<br>You have to listen carefully and then you repeat.<br>And you repeat this process over and over until the native speaker tells youthat he can no longer hear an accent when you read the sentence.<br>Now, I realize it can take a very long timeeven just to get one sentence right.<br>But I promise youif you are persistent, and if you patiently work on this,you’ll be amazed by what happens to your accent.<br>The second area to focus on is using verbs and expressions that locals use.<br>Now, we all know the situation that vocabulary can be region-specific.<br>Like, in the US, you use ‘stand in line.’In the UK, you ‘queue.’That’s all good.<br>But sometimes, the spoken word is so different,the speech is so different from what you get in textbooks,that the books are almost useless if you want to converse with natives.<br>I want to give you an example.<br>In the French language, there are words like ‘le travail,’which is ‘my work.’A French person talking to his friend would probably say ‘mon boulot,’which is a completely different word.<br>The same for ‘the clothes,’ ‘le vestments,’but you’ll hear ‘le fringues.’Or money is ‘l’argent,’but people say ‘le fric,’ ‘le sou,’ or many other expressions for this.<br>So, obviously I’m only scratching the surface here.<br>But here you actually have to learn all of these words and expressions one by one.<br>And of course, you have to interact with natives to do that.<br>But after you reach a critical mass that you’re comfortable with,it’ll actually be easier when you encounter something new.<br>You’ll just pick it up in one go, like native speakers would,who hear words or expressions that they didn’t know before.<br>The third area to work on is adopting cultural traits.<br>What do I mean by that?<br>So let me ask you:what does this gesture mean to you?<br>Any Italians here?<br>OK, now, depending on what culture you’re from,this could mean something rude,or it could just mean it’s something incredulous,like, ‘Why did you do that?’<br>Or, ‘How could you?’<br>Or it could just be signaling food, ‘Give me food!’<br>Interesting!<br>In the Middle East,this is just a standard way of signaling ‘Please, wait!’<br>So these kind of traits you have to internalize,and sometimes, they’re hard to spot,and it takes a lot of active listening.<br>I want to give you a few more examples.<br>So imagine I am with three of my friends: an American, a German, and a Frenchman.And, like, we’re walking and maybe the American bumps his head,and his initial reaction might be, ‘Ouch!’<br>That’s how you say it in English.But the German that, you know, gets, I don’t know, elbowed in the crowd,he would say, ‘Ow-ah!’<br>And the French person might step on the nail and say, ‘Ay!’<br>So this, of course, in your target language,this is something you have to observe and also internalize,and it has to become part of you.<br>If…<br>Again I’m with these three friends, and I sit with them,and let’s say I serve them tea,and I ask the American, ‘Would you like a biscuit with your tea?’<br>And if he answers in the affirmative, he might say, ‘Uh-huh!’<br>And I can ask the German, ‘Do you know what tea this is?’<br>He’ll say, ‘’Mm- hmm!’’<br>And then I ask the Frenchman, ‘Do you like this?’<br>He’ll say, ‘Hmm!’So these difference, they really require active listening.<br>So all of these three things that I told youwhich is pronunciation,and colloquial speech and adopting cultural traits,they all require that you interact with natives as much as possible.<br>Ideally, you should fully immerse yourself in the culture.<br>Now if you have the chance to live abroad for a while, that will be great.<br>Or maybe live among natives in your hometown.<br>Perhaps just have a romantic relationship,or even just spend time, you know, with co-workers.<br>So, romantic relationships, I could do a whole talk about that.<br>That works really well for these things.<br>But yeah -So this will be different for everybody, of course.<br>But even when you’re not around natives, your learning must not stop.<br>Because what you can do is you can watch TV shows and films,you can mimic the characters,you can write down anything that you haven’t heard of before,and practice that.<br>I also want to encourage you to learn the lyrics of songs.<br>Songs are really great because they tell stories.<br>And they not only help your pronunciation when you sing them,but if they’re emotional,they can anchor these expressions into your active vocabulary.<br>And it’s like speaking all day and really using the expressions unconsciously.<br>It’s a great way.<br>So music, definitely.<br>The other thing you need to move towards native-speaker statusis the right mindset,and a belief that if you sound like a native,express yourself like a native,talk like a native and act like a native,you’ll actually achieve a native-like level.<br>So if I could only leave you with one thing today,it would be: work on your pronunciation.<br>Because pronunciationhelps any stage of the learning process,even in the very beginning.<br>It’ll speed up everything.<br>And it also is the key to reaching a native-speaker level,or almost-native-speaker status.<br>So before I go,I’d like to tell you how I was able to overcome my fear of the Russian language.<br>It was a very, very elegant solution.<br>I married a Russian girl.<br>And I now have little kids in my home that speak Russian to me every day.<br>So I want to thank you.<br>(Applause)<br>And before I go, I just want to wish you(Spanish) A lot of success with your language studies.<br>(French)<br>It was a pleasure to present for you today.<br>(Hebrew)<br>I wish you lots of success with your studies.<br>(Yiddish)<br>Thank you for listening.<br>Good luck to you all and…<br>(Russian)<br>Thank you.<br>(Applause)</p>
