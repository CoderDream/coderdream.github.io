<h3 id="【英文脚本】"><a href="#【英文脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【英文脚本】"></a>【英文脚本】</h3><p>Neil<br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Neil and joining me today is Dan who is a producer at BBC Learning English, that’s his job.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Hi everyone… Yes that is my job, obviously, why are we discussing that now, Neil?</p>
<p>Neil<br>Well you haven’t always been a producer at BBC Learning English, have you?</p>
<p>Dan<br>No… I used to be a teacher.</p>
<p>Neil<br>And before that? Way back, your first ever job?</p>
<p>Dan<br>Ah, I had a paper round when I was 14. A paper round is a job, the job of delivering newspapers to people’s homes. It’s often done by teenagers.</p>
<p>Neil<br>14 seems very young to be at work. And that’s the topic of this 6 Minute English: Should schoolchildren have jobs? It seems fewer and fewer are these days, according to the statistics. We’ll give you 6 job-related words and expressions, and, of course, our quiz question. You Ready?</p>
<p>Dan<br>You bet!</p>
<p>Neil<br>What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK? a) 12 b) 13 c) 14</p>
<p>Dan<br>Well, I’m going to say 14 just because that’s how old I was and it seems a long time ago!</p>
<p>Neil<br>We’ll find out at the end of the programme. Let’s start by hearing some British teenagers talking about their Saturday jobs.</p>
<p>Dan<br>A Saturday job is the name we give to part-time work that teenagers do for extra money. As the name suggests, these jobs often take place on Saturdays, but not always.</p>
<p>Neil<br>That’s right - ‘Saturday job’ is general term we use to describe part-time work done by teenagers. The work might take place on Sundays or any day of the week, in fact! Let’s hear from these British children about their Saturday jobs.</p>
<p>Insert Vox<br>We have to face all the stuff on the shelves and make it look organised and show customers where products are if they need to know.</p>
<p>On the average week I work nine hours, so two hours for two school nights and then I<br>work four hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. And then in the school holidays I can work more.</p>
<p>Dan<br>The first kid said the work involves making the shelves look organised. Shop work is a very typical Saturday job.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Oh yes, I spent many a weekend and evening stacking shelves! The second teenager’s Saturday job takes place Saturdays, Sundays and evenings. As we said, A Saturday job’s not just for Saturdays.</p>
<p>Dan<br>A Saturday job is seen almost as a rite of passage in the UK. A rite of passage is the name we give to events or ceremonies that form an important stage in a person’s life.</p>
<p>Neil<br>That’s right, like graduating from school, or having children. But according to the latest statistics in the UK, that is all changing. Listen to this BBC report.</p>
<p>BBC reporter<br>In order to work, they need a permit from the local authority and our data shows the number being issued has fallen from nearly 30,000 permits in 2012 to just 23,000 in 2016. Employers frequently bemoan the lack of work experience young people have. But teenagers are also facing pressure not to take up part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies instead.</p>
<p>Dan<br>So, it seems that fewer teenagers are taking Saturday jobs. But there’s a conflict here.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Yes, on the one hand, employers bemoan the lack of work experience young people have. Bemoan, meaning complain about. It’s a rather formal word.</p>
<p>Dan<br>But on the other hand, teenagers are facing pressure not to take part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies. Some people think working could be detrimental to a schoolchild’s academic progress.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Detrimental - which means causing harm. It’s a tricky one, isn’t it? I think my Saturdays spend stacking shelves and serving fish ‘n’ chips taught me valuable lessons about working with adults and also managing my money. I don’t think it was detrimental to my education.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Well, you managed to get a job at BBC Learning English! As for me, my paper round taught me the value of hard work. It didn’t hinder me. Hinder means to stop someone or something from making progress.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Well let’s not talk too much in case we hinder our students… On to the answer to our quiz question. I asked this: What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK? a) 12 b) 13 c) 14</p>
<p>Dan<br>I said c) 14.</p>
<p>Neil<br>And I’m afraid you are wrong. You are allowed to work from the age of 13 in the UK. Exceptions to this rule include TV, theatre and modelling.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Oh well, I guess I should have spent more time at school.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary?</p>
<p>Dan<br>Did you have a paper round as a kid, Neil?</p>
<p>Neil<br>No I didn’t, but I did help my best friend James deliver newspapers - in return for a pound. Big money back in the 80s!</p>
<p>Dan<br>Did you supplement your earnings with a Saturday job?</p>
<p>Neil<br>I did. I had a Saturday job in a supermarket and also in a fish ‘n’ chip shop, but it wasn’t always on a Saturday. Free chips! Dan is that a wedding ring on your finger?</p>
<p>Dan<br>Yes it is. Marriage is a rite of passage in many cultures. It is an important stage in a person’s life, talking of which, are those your kids on your screensaver?</p>
<p>Neil<br>Yep, having children is another example of a rite of passage. See how tired I look!</p>
<p>Dan<br>Do not bemoan your lack of sleep! Bemoan’s a quite formal way of saying ‘complain about’.</p>
<p>Neil<br>I think it’s OK to bemoan my lack of sleep, it can have a detrimental effect on my health.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Detrimental, meaning harmful. As long as your tiredness doesn’t hinder your work on 6 Minute English</p>
<p>Neil<br>Well, I’d never let anything hinder, meaning stop from making progress, 6 Minute English.</p>
<p>Dan<br>I admire your dedication! Goodbye!</p>
<p>Neil<br>See ya!</p>

<p>Dan(担)<br>Hi everyone… Yes that is my job, obviously, why are we discussing that now, Neil?<br>大家好…是的，那是我的工作，显然，为什么我们现在要讨论这个问题，Neil？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well you haven’t always been a producer at BBC Learning English, have you?<br>嗯，你不是一直都是 BBC Learning English 的制作人，对吧？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>No… I used to be a teacher.<br>不。。。我曾经是一名教师。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And before that? Way back, your first ever job?<br>在此之前呢？很久以前，您的第一份工作？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Ah, I had a paper round when I was 14. A paper round is a job, the job of delivering newspapers to people’s homes. It’s often done by teenagers.<br>啊，我 14 岁时有过一次试卷。报纸轮是一份工作，是将报纸送到人们家的工作。它通常由青少年完成。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>14 seems very young to be at work. And that’s the topic of this 6 Minute English: Should schoolchildren have jobs? It seems fewer and fewer are these days, according to the statistics. We’ll give you 6 job-related words and expressions, and, of course, our quiz question. You Ready?<br>14 岁似乎很年轻。这就是这个六分钟英语的主题：小学生应该有工作吗？根据统计数据，现在似乎越来越少了。我们将为您提供 6 个与工作相关的单词和表达方式，当然还有我们的测验问题。准备好了吗？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>You bet!<br>当然！</p>

<p>Dan(担)<br>Well, I’m going to say 14 just because that’s how old I was and it seems a long time ago!<br>好吧，我要说 14 岁只是因为那是我当时的年龄，而且似乎是很久以前的事了！</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We’ll find out at the end of the programme. Let’s start by hearing some British teenagers talking about their Saturday jobs.<br>我们将在节目结束时找到答案。让我们先听听一些英国青少年谈论他们周六的工作。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>A Saturday job is the name we give to part-time work that teenagers do for extra money. As the name suggests, these jobs often take place on Saturdays, but not always.<br>周六工作是我们给青少年做兼职工作以赚取额外收入的名称。顾名思义，这些工作通常在周六进行，但并非总是如此。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That’s right - ‘Saturday job’ is general term we use to describe part-time work done by teenagers. The work might take place on Sundays or any day of the week, in fact! Let’s hear from these British children about their Saturday jobs.<br>没错 - “周六工作”是我们用来描述青少年所做的兼职工作的通用术语。事实上，工作可能在星期日或一周中的任何一天进行！让我们听听这些英国孩子关于他们周六的工作。</p>
<p>Insert Vox(插入Vox)<br>We have to face all the stuff on the shelves and make it look organised and show customers where products are if they need to know.<br>我们必须面对货架上的所有东西，让它看起来井井有条，并在客户需要知道时向他们展示产品在哪里。</p>
<p>On the average week I work nine hours, so two hours for two school nights and then I(平均每周我工作9小时，所以两个学校晚上2小时，然后我)<br>work four hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. And then in the school holidays I can work more.<br>周六工作 4 小时，周日工作 2 小时。然后在学校假期，我可以多工作。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>The first kid said the work involves making the shelves look organised. Shop work is a very typical Saturday job.<br>第一个孩子说，这项工作包括让货架看起来井井有条。商店工作是一份非常典型的周六工作。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Oh yes, I spent many a weekend and evening stacking shelves! The second teenager’s Saturday job takes place Saturdays, Sundays and evenings. As we said, A Saturday job’s not just for Saturdays.<br>哦，是的，我花了很多周末和晚上堆放货架！第二个青少年的周六工作在周六、周日和晚上进行。正如我们所说，周六的工作不仅仅是周六的。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>A Saturday job is seen almost as a rite of passage in the UK. A rite of passage is the name we give to events or ceremonies that form an important stage in a person’s life.<br>在英国，周六工作几乎被视为一种成人仪式。成人仪式是我们给构成一个人生命中重要阶段的事件或仪式起的名字。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That’s right, like graduating from school, or having children. But according to the latest statistics in the UK, that is all changing. Listen to this BBC report.<br>没错，比如从学校毕业，或者生孩子。但根据英国的最新统计数据，这一切都正在改变。请听 BBC 的报道。</p>
<p>BBC reporter(BBC记者)<br>In order to work, they need a permit from the local authority and our data shows the number being issued has fallen from nearly 30,000 permits in 2012 to just 23,000 in 2016. Employers frequently bemoan the lack of work experience young people have. But teenagers are also facing pressure not to take up part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies instead.<br>为了工作，他们需要地方当局的许可证，我们的数据显示，发放的许可证数量已从 2012 年的近 30,000 份下降到 2016 年的仅 23,000 份。雇主经常哀叹年轻人缺乏工作经验。但青少年也面临着不从事兼职工作而专注于学习的压力。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>So, it seems that fewer teenagers are taking Saturday jobs. But there’s a conflict here.<br>因此，似乎越来越少的青少年在周六打工。但这里有一个冲突。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, on the one hand, employers bemoan the lack of work experience young people have. Bemoan, meaning complain about. It’s a rather formal word.<br>是的，一方面，雇主哀叹年轻人缺乏工作经验。Bemoan，意思是抱怨。这是一个相当正式的词。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>But on the other hand, teenagers are facing pressure not to take part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies. Some people think working could be detrimental to a schoolchild’s academic progress.<br>但另一方面，青少年面临着不做兼职工作并专注于学习的压力。有些人认为工作可能不利于学童的学业进步。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Detrimental - which means causing harm. It’s a tricky one, isn’t it? I think my Saturdays spend stacking shelves and serving fish ‘n’ chips taught me valuable lessons about working with adults and also managing my money. I don’t think it was detrimental to my education.<br>有害的 - 这意味着造成伤害。这是一个棘手的问题，不是吗？我认为我周六花在堆货架和提供炸鱼薯条上的时间教会了我关于与成年人合作以及管理我的资金的宝贵经验。我不认为这对我的教育有害。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Well, you managed to get a job at BBC Learning English! As for me, my paper round taught me the value of hard work. It didn’t hinder me. Hinder means to stop someone or something from making progress.<br>好吧，您设法在 BBC Learning English 找到了一份工作！至于我，我的论文轮次教会了我努力工作的价值。它并没有阻碍我。阻碍的意思是阻止某人或某事取得进展。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well let’s not talk too much in case we hinder our students… On to the answer to our quiz question. I asked this: What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK? a) 12 b) 13 c) 14<br>好吧，我们不要多说什么，以免我们阻碍我们的学生……接下来是我们的测验问题的答案。我问这个问题：在英国，允许儿童工作的最小年龄是多少？a） 12 b） 13 c） 14</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>I said c) 14.<br>我说 c） 14.</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And I’m afraid you are wrong. You are allowed to work from the age of 13 in the UK. Exceptions to this rule include TV, theatre and modelling.<br>恐怕你错了。在英国，您可以从 13 岁开始工作。此规则的例外情况包括电视、剧院和模特。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Oh well, I guess I should have spent more time at school.<br>哦，好吧，我想我应该花更多的时间在学校。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary?<br>我们应该回顾一下词汇吗？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Did you have a paper round as a kid, Neil?<br>你小时候有过一轮纸比赛吗，Neil？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>No I didn’t, but I did help my best friend James deliver newspapers - in return for a pound. Big money back in the 80s!<br>不，我没有，但我确实帮助我最好的朋友詹姆斯送报纸 —— 换取一英镑。回到 80 年代的大笔资金！</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Did you supplement your earnings with a Saturday job?<br>你有没有用周六的工作来补充你的收入？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I did. I had a Saturday job in a supermarket and also in a fish ‘n’ chip shop, but it wasn’t always on a Saturday. Free chips! Dan is that a wedding ring on your finger?<br>我做了。我周六在一家超市和一家炸鱼薯条店工作，但并不总是在周六。免费筹码！Dan 那是你手指上的结婚戒指吗？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Yes it is. Marriage is a rite of passage in many cultures. It is an important stage in a person’s life, talking of which, are those your kids on your screensaver?<br>是的，它是。在许多文化中，结婚是一种成人仪式。这是一个人一生中的一个重要阶段，说到哪个，你的孩子在你的屏保上吗？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yep, having children is another example of a rite of passage. See how tired I look!<br>是的，生孩子是另一个成人仪式的例子。看看我看起来有多累！</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Do not bemoan your lack of sleep! Bemoan’s a quite formal way of saying ‘complain about’.<br>不要哀叹你睡眠不足！Bemoan 是 “抱怨” 的一种非常正式的说法。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I think it’s OK to bemoan my lack of sleep, it can have a detrimental effect on my health.<br>我认为哀叹我睡眠不足是可以的，它会对我的健康产生不利影响。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Detrimental, meaning harmful. As long as your tiredness doesn’t hinder your work on 6 Minute English<br>有害的，意思是有害的。只要你的疲惫不妨碍你在六分钟英语上的工作</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, I’d never let anything hinder, meaning stop from making progress, 6 Minute English.<br>好吧，我永远不会让任何事情阻碍，意思是停止进步，6 分钟英语。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>I admire your dedication! Goodbye!<br>我佩服你的奉献精神！再见！</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>See ya!<br>再见！</p>
