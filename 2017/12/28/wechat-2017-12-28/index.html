<h3 id="【英文脚本】"><a href="#【英文脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【英文脚本】"></a>【英文脚本】</h3><p>Dan<br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Dan, and joining me today is Neil. Hi, Neil.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Hi, everyone!</p>
<p>Dan<br>Bless you! Are you ok?</p>
<p>Neil<br>I think I’m coming down with something serious.</p>
<p>Dan<br>It’s just a case of the sniffles.</p>
<p>Neil<br>The sniffles is an informal way of saying a cold or flu. It comes from the sniffing sound people make when they have a runny nose.</p>
<p>Dan<br>And a runny nose is when liquid mucus keeps leaking from our nose, usually when we are sick. I’m afraid you’ll just have to soldier on Neil.</p>
<p>Neil<br>To soldier on means to continue despite difficulty. I’m dying! What’s it about anyway?</p>
<p>Dan<br>It’s about ‘man flu’, and whether it’s actually real, or just something men like to complain about. We’ll give you 6 words and expressions, and, of course, our quiz question.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Alright, fire away.</p>
<p>Dan<br>In a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put? a) 1 day b) 2 days c) 3 days</p>
<p>Neil<br>I’m going to say 3 days. The threat of ‘man flu’ is real.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Well, we’ll find out later, but let’s clarify. ‘Man flu’ is the tendency that many people believe men have to complain about a minor illness, such as a cold or flu, and act as if they were suffering from something a lot more serious.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Yes. But science cannot say whether men do actually suffer more than women, or if men just tend to complain more.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Well, let’s hear from this British couple about whether they think ‘man flu’ is real or not.</p>
<p>British Man<br>Men definitely do suffer a lot more, I think, than women do when we get flu.</p>
<p>British Woman<br>Yeah, I’m not so convinced. I feel like they just complain more.</p>
<p>British Man<br>It wipes me out.</p>
<p>British Woman<br>I was ill recently and I just carried on and went to work and everything. And when Chris had got sick recently he was on the sofa and couldn’t really do anything, so…</p>
<p>Dan<br>And it seems that it’s not just in the UK. Listen to this BBC Journalist interviewing a woman from Europe.</p>
<p>BBC Journalist<br>You’re from the Netherlands. Have you ever accused your boyfriend of having man flu?</p>
<p>Dutch woman<br>Oh, absolutely yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>BBC Journalist<br>What have you accused him of doing?</p>
<p>Dutch woman<br>…whining?</p>
<p>Neil<br>Whining is when someone complains repeatedly and often in an annoying way about something. So, there certainly seems to be something there…but nothing has been proven, right?</p>
<p>Dan<br>Well, a recent scientific study has indicated that there could be something to ‘man flu’ after all. Doctor Kyle Sue, an assistant professor of family medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, has suggested that there could be a difference between men and women when it comes to respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Respiratory meaning related to breathing. He says that there was already a lot of evidence from existing studies suggesting men experience worse, longer-lasting symptoms.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Symptoms are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. Listen to him explain why this is.</p>
<p>Doctor Kyle Sue, Memorial University, Newfoundland<br>It seems that the higher the testosterone levels, the lower the immune response to these types of infections, whereas the higher the oestrogen level, the stronger the immune response.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Testosterone and oestrogen are hormones that exist in both men and women. Testosterone is higher in males and oestrogen is higher in females. Dr. Sue’s research suggests that the more oestrogen a person has, the better able they are to fight off the infection. That’s it then! Man flu is real!</p>
<p>Dan<br>Hold your horses, Neil. There are two problems. First of all, the Royal college of GPs in the UK says that there is no such thing as ‘man flu’. And secondly, even Dr Sue admits that these results, including his own, are only ‘suggestive’ and are not ‘definitive’.</p>
<p>Neil<br>So, basically he’s saying that there is a suggestion that ‘man flu’ exists, but the evidence so far cannot say for sure.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Exactly. More studies need to be done. But you know what we can be sure about? The answer to this week’s quiz question. I asked you in a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put? a) 1 day b) 2 days c) 3 days</p>
<p>Neil<br>And I said 3 days.</p>
<p>Dan<br>And you were right!</p>
<p>Neil<br>Good!</p>
<p>Dan<br>The men said they took twice as long to recover!</p>
<p>Neil<br>It must be all that manly testosterone. Let’s review our vocabulary, shall we? Before I have to have a lie down?</p>
<p>Dan<br>Our first was the sniffles. If you have the sniffles, you have a cold, informally speaking. What’s the best cure for the sniffles Neil?</p>
<p>Neil<br>Stay in bed and sweat it out, my mum always said. Just make sure you have lots of tissues to deal with your runny nose. That’s when a person’s nose leaks mucus, usually because they are ill. Yuck!</p>
<p>Dan<br>Next we had soldier on. This phrasal verb means to continue despite difficulty. When was the last time you had to soldier on, Neil?</p>
<p>Neil<br>A few days ago when I went the whole day without eating any lunch! Then we had ‘man flu’. That’s is the name given to the situation where a person, often a man, tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold. Do you do that, Dan?</p>
<p>Dan<br>I’m sure my wife would say I do! Next we had whining. If you whine, you complain repeatedly and often in an annoying way.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Like my children did last time I didn’t buy them ice-cream. And finally we had symptoms. These are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. What are the symptoms of flu, Dan?</p>
<p>Dan<br>A headache, aching muscles, and a fever. And that’s the end of this 6 Minute English! Don’t forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. There you made it. You can collapse now.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Bye.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Bye!</p>

<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hi, everyone!<br>嗨，大家好！</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Bless you! Are you ok?<br>保佑你！你没事吧？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I think I’m coming down with something serious.<br>我想我遇到了一些严重的事情。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>It’s just a case of the sniffles.<br>这只是流鼻涕的一个例子。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The sniffles is an informal way of saying a cold or flu. It comes from the sniffing sound people make when they have a runny nose.<br>sniffles 是感冒或流感的非正式说法。它来自人们流鼻涕时发出的嗅闻声。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>And a runny nose is when liquid mucus keeps leaking from our nose, usually when we are sick. I’m afraid you’ll just have to soldier on Neil.<br>流鼻涕是指液体粘液不断从我们的鼻子中流出，通常是在我们生病的时候。恐怕你得对付 Neil。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To soldier on means to continue despite difficulty. I’m dying! What’s it about anyway?<br>to soldier on 的意思是尽管困难，但要继续。我快死了！这到底是怎么回事呢？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>It’s about ‘man flu’, and whether it’s actually real, or just something men like to complain about. We’ll give you 6 words and expressions, and, of course, our quiz question.<br>它是关于“男人流感”的，以及它是否真的存在，或者只是男人喜欢抱怨的事情。我们将为您提供 6 个单词和表达方式，当然还有我们的测验问题。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Alright, fire away.<br>好了，开火吧。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>In a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put? a) 1 day b) 2 days c) 3 days<br>在 Nuts 杂志进行的一项调查中，询问读者从感冒或流感中恢复需要多长时间，女性平均需要 1.5 天，男性服用了什么？a） 1 天 b） 2 天 c） 3 天</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m going to say 3 days. The threat of ‘man flu’ is real.<br>我要说 3 天。“人流感”的威胁是真实存在的。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Well, we’ll find out later, but let’s clarify. ‘Man flu’ is the tendency that many people believe men have to complain about a minor illness, such as a cold or flu, and act as if they were suffering from something a lot more serious.<br>好吧，我们稍后会知道，但让我们澄清一下。“人流感”是许多人认为男性必须抱怨小病（如感冒或流感）的倾向，并表现得好像他们患有更严重的事情一样。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes. But science cannot say whether men do actually suffer more than women, or if men just tend to complain more.<br>是的。但科学无法说男性是否真的比女性遭受更多的痛苦，或者男性是否只是倾向于抱怨更多。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Well, let’s hear from this British couple about whether they think ‘man flu’ is real or not.<br>好吧，让我们听听这对英国夫妇的意见，他们是否认为“男人流感”是真的。</p>
<p>British Man(英国人)<br>Men definitely do suffer a lot more, I think, than women do when we get flu.<br>我认为，当我们患流感时，男性肯定比女性遭受的痛苦要多得多。</p>
<p>British Woman(英国女士)<br>Yeah, I’m not so convinced. I feel like they just complain more.<br>是的，我不太相信。我觉得他们只是抱怨更多。</p>
<p>British Man(英国人)<br>It wipes me out.<br>它把我消灭了。</p>
<p>British Woman(英国女士)<br>I was ill recently and I just carried on and went to work and everything. And when Chris had got sick recently he was on the sofa and couldn’t really do anything, so…<br>我最近生病了，我只是继续工作，去工作，做所有事情。当 Chris 最近生病时，他躺在沙发上，什么都做不了，所以……</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>And it seems that it’s not just in the UK. Listen to this BBC Journalist interviewing a woman from Europe.<br>而且似乎不仅仅是在英国。请听这位 BBC 记者采访一位来自欧洲的女性。</p>
<p>BBC Journalist(BBC记者)<br>You’re from the Netherlands. Have you ever accused your boyfriend of having man flu?<br>您来自荷兰。你有没有指责过你的男朋友得了男流感？</p>
<p>Dutch woman(荷兰女人)<br>Oh, absolutely yes. Yeah.<br>哦，绝对没错。是的。</p>
<p>BBC Journalist(BBC记者)<br>What have you accused him of doing?<br>你指责他做了什么？</p>
<p>Dutch woman(荷兰女人)<br>…whining?<br>…抱怨？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Whining is when someone complains repeatedly and often in an annoying way about something. So, there certainly seems to be something there…but nothing has been proven, right?<br>抱怨是指有人反复抱怨某事，而且经常以令人讨厌的方式抱怨。所以，那里似乎肯定有什么东西……但什么都没有得到证实，对吧？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Well, a recent scientific study has indicated that there could be something to ‘man flu’ after all. Doctor Kyle Sue, an assistant professor of family medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, has suggested that there could be a difference between men and women when it comes to respiratory diseases.<br>嗯，最近的一项科学研究表明，“人流感”毕竟可能有一些东西。加拿大纽芬兰纪念大学（Memorial University of Newfoundland）家庭医学助理教授凯尔·苏（Kyle Sue）医生表示，在呼吸系统疾病方面，男性和女性可能存在差异。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Respiratory meaning related to breathing. He says that there was already a lot of evidence from existing studies suggesting men experience worse, longer-lasting symptoms.<br>与呼吸相关的呼吸意义。他说，现有研究中已经有很多证据表明，男性的症状会更严重、更持久。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Symptoms are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. Listen to him explain why this is.<br>症状是由疾病引起的疾病感觉。请听他解释为什么会这样。</p>
<p>Doctor Kyle Sue, Memorial University, Newfoundland(KyleSue博士，纽芬兰纪念大学)<br>It seems that the higher the testosterone levels, the lower the immune response to these types of infections, whereas the higher the oestrogen level, the stronger the immune response.<br>似乎睾酮水平越高，对这些类型感染的免疫反应越低，而雌激素水平越高，免疫反应越强。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Testosterone and oestrogen are hormones that exist in both men and women. Testosterone is higher in males and oestrogen is higher in females. Dr. Sue’s research suggests that the more oestrogen a person has, the better able they are to fight off the infection. That’s it then! Man flu is real!<br>睾丸激素和雌激素是男性和女性都存在的激素。男性的睾丸激素较高，女性的雌激素较高。Sue 博士的研究表明，一个人的雌激素越多，他们抵抗感染的能力就越强。就是这样！人流感是真的！</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Hold your horses, Neil. There are two problems. First of all, the Royal college of GPs in the UK says that there is no such thing as ‘man flu’. And secondly, even Dr Sue admits that these results, including his own, are only ‘suggestive’ and are not ‘definitive’.<br>稳住你的马，尼尔。有两个问题。首先，英国皇家全科医生学院表示，没有“人流感”这样的东西。其次，就连 Sue 博士也承认，这些结果，包括他自己的结果，只是“提示性的”，而不是“决定性的”。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So, basically he’s saying that there is a suggestion that ‘man flu’ exists, but the evidence so far cannot say for sure.<br>所以，基本上他是说有迹象表明“人流感”存在，但到目前为止的证据还不能确定。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Exactly. More studies need to be done. But you know what we can be sure about? The answer to this week’s quiz question. I asked you in a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put? a) 1 day b) 2 days c) 3 days<br>完全。需要做更多的研究。但您知道我们可以确定什么吗？本周测验问题的答案。我在 坚果 杂志进行的一项调查中问你，询问读者他们需要多长时间才能从感冒或流感中恢复过来，女性平均需要 1.5 天，男性放了什么？a） 1 天 b） 2 天 c） 3 天</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And I said 3 days.<br>我说 3 天。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>And you were right!<br>你是对的！</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Good!<br>好！</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>The men said they took twice as long to recover!<br>这些人说他们花了两倍的时间才恢复过来！</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>It must be all that manly testosterone. Let’s review our vocabulary, shall we? Before I have to have a lie down?<br>它一定是所有男子气概的睾丸激素。让我们回顾一下我们的词汇，好吗？在我必须躺下之前？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Our first was the sniffles. If you have the sniffles, you have a cold, informally speaking. What’s the best cure for the sniffles Neil?<br>我们首先是鼻涕。如果你有流鼻涕，非正式地说，你得感冒了。尼尔流鼻涕的最佳治疗方法是什么？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Stay in bed and sweat it out, my mum always said. Just make sure you have lots of tissues to deal with your runny nose. That’s when a person’s nose leaks mucus, usually because they are ill. Yuck!<br>躺在床上，大汗淋漓，我妈妈总是说。只要确保你有很多组织来处理你的流鼻涕。那是一个人的鼻子漏出粘液的时候，通常是因为他们生病了。呸！</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Next we had soldier on. This phrasal verb means to continue despite difficulty. When was the last time you had to soldier on, Neil?<br>接下来，我们有士兵。这个短语动词的意思是尽管困难，但要继续。尼尔，你上一次不得不继续战斗是什么时候？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>A few days ago when I went the whole day without eating any lunch! Then we had ‘man flu’. That’s is the name given to the situation where a person, often a man, tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold. Do you do that, Dan?<br>几天前，我一整天都没吃午饭！然后我们得了’人流感’。这是一个人（通常是男性）倾向于抱怨和夸大感冒等小病的情况的名称。丹，你这样做吗？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>I’m sure my wife would say I do! Next we had whining. If you whine, you complain repeatedly and often in an annoying way.<br>我敢肯定我的妻子会说我愿意！接下来我们开始抱怨。如果你抱怨，你会反复抱怨，而且经常以令人讨厌的方式抱怨。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Like my children did last time I didn’t buy them ice-cream. And finally we had symptoms. These are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. What are the symptoms of flu, Dan?<br>就像我的孩子上次做的那样，我没有给他们买冰淇淋。最后我们出现了症状。这些是由疾病引起的疾病感觉。流感的症状是什么，丹？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>A headache, aching muscles, and a fever. And that’s the end of this 6 Minute English! Don’t forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. There you made it. You can collapse now.<br>头痛、肌肉酸痛和发烧。这就是这个六分钟英语的结尾！不要忘记查看我们的 YouTube、Facebook、Twitter 和 Instagram 页面。你成功了。您现在可以崩溃。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Bye.<br>再见。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Bye!<br>再见！</p>
