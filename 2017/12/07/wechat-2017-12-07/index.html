<h3 id="【英文脚本】"><a href="#【英文脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【英文脚本】"></a>【英文脚本】</h3><p>Neil<br>Hello and welcome to Six Minute English. I’m Neil and joining me today is Dan, who is weighed down with shopping bags and wearing something very… strange. What’s going on, Dan?</p>
<p>Dan<br>Hi everyone. Well, I was feeling a bit miserable so I decided to cheer myself up by going shopping!</p>
<p>Neil<br>Well that’s lucky because the link between shopping and mood is what we’re looking at in this 6 Minute English, and of course we’ll be giving you six mood and shopping-related vocabulary items. But first, our quiz:</p>
<p>Online shoppers in which country spend more per household than consumers in any other<br>country, according to a report from the UK Cards Association? a) The USA b) Norway c) The UK</p>
<p>Dan<br>Norway seems to come top of lots of lists, so for that reason alone I’m going to say Norway.</p>
<p>Neil<br>We’ll find out at the end of the show. Now, Dan, you said just now that you went shopping because you were feeling down.</p>
<p>Dan<br>That’s right, I like a bit of retail therapy.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Retail therapy is a humorous expression which means going shopping to make yourself feel better.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Oh I do that all the time.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Yes, I can see. And you’re not alone. According to some research done by the website moneysupermarket.com, people are more likely to buy things they’ll later regret when they’re feeling sad, bored or stressed.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Well I was feeling a bit down in the dumps. And that’s a way of saying ‘sad’.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Oh dear, Dan. Sorry to hear you’ve been down in the dumps. I only hope you don’t also get a pang of regret about your purchases when you get them home, the research suggests that you will.</p>
<p>Dan<br>A pang is a sharp pain. We often hear it used figuratively to talk about strong emotions like guilt, regret and remorse. You’re making me feel worse, Neil</p>
<p>Neil<br>Sorry Dan, it’s all for educational purposes! Our audience will learn from your pain! Remorse is like regret, and there’s a good expression to describe exactly that bad feeling you get when you realise you don’t really need or want the thing you’ve bought. Buyer’s remorse.</p>
<p>Dan<br>OK, OK, OK enough about me. Let’s hear from Sam, Phil and Catherine from the Learning English team to see if their mood affects the shopping choices they make. Listen carefully. Can you hear the three types of things they say that they buy when they’re down in the dumps?</p>
<p>Sam<br>Honestly, I tend to buy food. Anything that will bring me comfort, so it can be any sort of warm drink, hot drink but also anything kind of warm and cosy, so like a nice jumper.</p>
<p>Phil<br>Definitely, if I’ve had a bad day at work, or for whatever reason or I feel terrible, tired, I am more likely to buy something on the way home.</p>
<p>Catherine<br>Oh when I’m feeling sad, I probably buy a little bit of wine and often something to wear. I find that a bit of retail therapy when I’m sad usually does the trick at the time, so it makes me feel better. But I do find that when I look in my wardrobe, the things that I bought when I was sad, I never wear them.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Sam, Phil and Catherine there from the BBC Learning English team talking about what kind of things they buy when they’re feeling down. What were they?</p>
<p>Dan<br>Food, drink and clothes.</p>
<p>Neil<br>That’s right. Sam mentioned she buys food, warm drinks and a nice jumper to keep her cosy. That’s the feeling of being warm, comfortable and relaxed.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Catherine also mentioned drinks, this time wine. And she also said that buying clothes does the trick. That means achieves the result she intended. She feels down, she buys clothes, she feels better, it does the trick.</p>
<p>Neil<br>But what’s interesting is that Catherine said she never wears the clothes she buys when she’s feeling sad. That’s exactly what the survey found, people regret the purchases they make when they’re sad, bored or stressed.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Sounds like a case of buyer’s remorse.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Indeed. Well, time now for the answer to our quiz question. I asked this: Online shoppers in which country spend more per household than consumers in any other country, according to a report from the UK Cards Association? Is it: a) The USA b) Norway c) The UK</p>
<p>Dan<br>I said b) Norway.</p>
<p>Neil<br>And I’m afraid you might need to go and buy some more stuff to cheer you up, you’re wrong! The correct answer is the UK. Apparently UK households spent the equivalent of $5,900 (£4,611) using payment cards online in 2015.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Well, I hope they were happy when they made those purchases or they may feel the pang of regret I’m scared I might get after today’s discussion!</p>
<p>Neil<br>Well, a good recap of the vocabulary from this programme might do the trick.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Shall we start with the first word? Do you ever go in for a bit of retail therapy, Neil?</p>
<p>Neil<br>Actually I try to avoid it. Especially after reading this survey, I don’t think the happiness you feel after buying something lasts very long. In fact, you can end up feeling down in the dumps.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Down in the dumps - meaning sad&#x2F;unhappy. Yes and a pang of regret might follow once you realise you’ve spent a lot of money on something you don’t really need.</p>
<p>Neil<br>A pang is a stab, used here figuratively to mean a sharp pain used to talk about strong emotions. And after the pang can come buyer’s remorse.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Hmm, I’m beginning to feel buyer’s remorse from this leopard skin onesie. Seemed like such a good idea at the time.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Well it does look cozy, warm comfortable and relaxed, so I think if that’s what you wanted, it does the trick.</p>
<p>Dan<br>Does the trick, meaning achieves the result you wanted.</p>
<p>Neil<br>OK before Dan heads off to buy even more stuff he doesn’t need, please remember to check out our Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages.</p>
<p>Both<br>Bye!</p>
<h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello and welcome to Six Minute English. I’m Neil and joining me today is Dan, who is weighed down with shopping bags and wearing something very… strange. What’s going on, Dan?<br>您好，欢迎来到 Six Minute English。我是 Neil，今天和我一起的是 Dan，他背着购物袋，穿着非常……奇怪。怎么回事，丹？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Hi everyone. Well, I was feeling a bit miserable so I decided to cheer myself up by going shopping!<br>大家好。嗯，我感觉有点痛苦，所以我决定去购物让自己振作起来！</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well that’s lucky because the link between shopping and mood is what we’re looking at in this 6 Minute English, and of course we’ll be giving you six mood and shopping-related vocabulary items. But first, our quiz:<br>嗯，这很幸运，因为购物和心情之间的联系就是我们在这篇六分钟英语中所看到的，当然，我们将为您提供六个与心情和购物相关的词汇项目。但首先，我们的测验：</p>
<p>Online shoppers in which country spend more per household than consumers in any other(哪个国家&#x2F;地区的在线购物者每户消费比其他任何国家的消费者都多)<br>country, according to a report from the UK Cards Association? a) The USA b) Norway c) The UK<br>国家，根据英国卡协会的一份报告？a） 美国 b） 挪威 c） 英国</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Norway seems to come top of lots of lists, so for that reason alone I’m going to say Norway.<br>挪威似乎在许多名单中名列前茅，所以仅出于这个原因，我就要说挪威。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We’ll find out at the end of the show. Now, Dan, you said just now that you went shopping because you were feeling down.<br>我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，Dan，你刚才说你去购物是因为你感觉很沮丧。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>That’s right, I like a bit of retail therapy.<br>没错，我喜欢一点购物疗法。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Retail therapy is a humorous expression which means going shopping to make yourself feel better.<br>购物疗法是一种幽默的表达方式，意思是去购物让自己感觉更好。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Oh I do that all the time.<br>哦，我一直都是这样做的。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I can see. And you’re not alone. According to some research done by the website moneysupermarket.com, people are more likely to buy things they’ll later regret when they’re feeling sad, bored or stressed.<br>是的，我可以看到。而且你并不孤单。根据该网站 moneysupermarket.com 所做的一些研究，人们更有可能购买后来在感到悲伤、无聊或压力时会后悔的东西。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Well I was feeling a bit down in the dumps. And that’s a way of saying ‘sad’.<br>好吧，我在垃圾堆里感觉有点沮丧。这是 “悲伤 ”的一种说法。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Oh dear, Dan. Sorry to hear you’ve been down in the dumps. I only hope you don’t also get a pang of regret about your purchases when you get them home, the research suggests that you will.<br>哦，天哪，丹。很遗憾听到你一直在垃圾堆里。我只希望你在把它们带回家时也不会对你的购买感到后悔，研究表明你会的。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>A pang is a sharp pain. We often hear it used figuratively to talk about strong emotions like guilt, regret and remorse. You’re making me feel worse, Neil<br>疼痛是一种剧烈的疼痛。我们经常听到它被比喻地用来谈论强烈的情绪，如内疚、遗憾和懊悔。你让我感觉更糟了，尼尔</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Sorry Dan, it’s all for educational purposes! Our audience will learn from your pain! Remorse is like regret, and there’s a good expression to describe exactly that bad feeling you get when you realise you don’t really need or want the thing you’ve bought. Buyer’s remorse.<br>对不起，Dan，这都是为了教育目的！我们的观众会从你的痛苦中学习！懊悔就像遗憾，有一个很好的表达方式来准确描述当你意识到你并不真正需要或想要你所买的东西时所获得的那种不好的感觉。买方的悔恨。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>OK, OK, OK enough about me. Let’s hear from Sam, Phil and Catherine from the Learning English team to see if their mood affects the shopping choices they make. Listen carefully. Can you hear the three types of things they say that they buy when they’re down in the dumps?<br>好的，好的，关于我就够了。让我们听听 Learning English 团队的 Sam、Phil 和 Catherine 怎么说，看看他们的心情是否会影响他们的购物选择。䏃。你能听到他们说的三种东西是他们在垃圾场里买的吗？</p>
<p>Sam(山姆)<br>Honestly, I tend to buy food. Anything that will bring me comfort, so it can be any sort of warm drink, hot drink but also anything kind of warm and cosy, so like a nice jumper.<br>老实说，我倾向于购买食物。任何能给我带来舒适的东西，所以它可以是任何种类的热饮、热饮，也可以是任何温暖和舒适的东西，比如一件漂亮的套头衫。</p>
<p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Definitely, if I’ve had a bad day at work, or for whatever reason or I feel terrible, tired, I am more likely to buy something on the way home.<br>当然，如果我在工作中度过了糟糕的一天，或者出于某种原因，或者我感到非常糟糕、疲惫，我更有可能在回家的路上买东西。</p>
<p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Oh when I’m feeling sad, I probably buy a little bit of wine and often something to wear. I find that a bit of retail therapy when I’m sad usually does the trick at the time, so it makes me feel better. But I do find that when I look in my wardrobe, the things that I bought when I was sad, I never wear them.<br>哦，当我感到难过时，我可能会买一点酒，经常买点衣服穿。我发现当我难过时，一点购物疗法通常会起到作用，所以它让我感觉更好。但我确实发现，当我查看我的衣橱时，我从不穿那些在我悲伤时买的东西。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Sam, Phil and Catherine there from the BBC Learning English team talking about what kind of things they buy when they’re feeling down. What were they?<br>来自 BBC Learning English 团队的 Sam、Phil 和 Catherine 在那里谈论他们在情绪低落时购买什么样的东西。他们是什么？</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Food, drink and clothes.<br>食物、饮料和衣服。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That’s right. Sam mentioned she buys food, warm drinks and a nice jumper to keep her cosy. That’s the feeling of being warm, comfortable and relaxed.<br>没错。山姆提到她会买食物、热饮和一件漂亮的套头衫来保持舒适。那是温暖、舒适和放松的感觉。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Catherine also mentioned drinks, this time wine. And she also said that buying clothes does the trick. That means achieves the result she intended. She feels down, she buys clothes, she feels better, it does the trick.<br>凯瑟琳还提到了饮料，这次是葡萄酒。她还说，买衣服可以解决问题。这意味着达到了她想要的结果。她感到沮丧，她买衣服，她感觉好多了，这起到了作用。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But what’s interesting is that Catherine said she never wears the clothes she buys when she’s feeling sad. That’s exactly what the survey found, people regret the purchases they make when they’re sad, bored or stressed.<br>但有趣的是，凯瑟琳说，当她感到悲伤时，她从不穿她买的衣服。这正是调查发现的，人们在悲伤、无聊或压力时会后悔他们所做的购买。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Sounds like a case of buyer’s remorse.<br>听起来像是买家后悔的案例。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Indeed. Well, time now for the answer to our quiz question. I asked this: Online shoppers in which country spend more per household than consumers in any other country, according to a report from the UK Cards Association? Is it: a) The USA b) Norway c) The UK<br>事实上。好吧，现在是回答我们的测验问题的时候了。我问这个问题：根据英国卡协会的一份报告，哪个国家&#x2F;地区的在线购物者每户家庭消费比其他任何国家的消费者都多？是：a） 美国 b） 挪威 c） 英国</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>I said b) Norway.<br>我说 b） 挪威。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And I’m afraid you might need to go and buy some more stuff to cheer you up, you’re wrong! The correct answer is the UK. Apparently UK households spent the equivalent of $5,900 (£4,611) using payment cards online in 2015.<br>而且我担心你可能需要去买更多的东西来让你振作起来，你错了！正确答案是英国。显然，2015 年英国家庭使用在线支付卡花费了相当于 5,900 美元（4,611 英镑）的费用。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Well, I hope they were happy when they made those purchases or they may feel the pang of regret I’m scared I might get after today’s discussion!<br>好吧，我希望他们在购买这些商品时感到高兴，否则他们可能会感到遗憾，我担心在今天的讨论之后我可能会感到遗憾！</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, a good recap of the vocabulary from this programme might do the trick.<br>好吧，很好地回顾一下这个程序中的词汇可能会奏效。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Shall we start with the first word? Do you ever go in for a bit of retail therapy, Neil?<br>我们应该从第一个词开始吗？Neil，你有没有去过购物疗法？</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Actually I try to avoid it. Especially after reading this survey, I don’t think the happiness you feel after buying something lasts very long. In fact, you can end up feeling down in the dumps.<br>事实上，我试图避免它。尤其是在阅读了这份调查之后，我认为你买东西后的快乐感不会持续很长时间。事实上，您最终可能会感到沮丧。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Down in the dumps - meaning sad&#x2F;unhappy. Yes and a pang of regret might follow once you realise you’ve spent a lot of money on something you don’t really need.<br>Down in the dumps - 意思是悲伤&#x2F;不快乐。是的，一旦你意识到你花了很多钱在你并不真正需要的东西上，你可能会感到遗憾。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>A pang is a stab, used here figuratively to mean a sharp pain used to talk about strong emotions. And after the pang can come buyer’s remorse.<br>pang 是 stab，在这里比喻地表示剧烈的疼痛，用来谈论强烈的情绪。痛苦之后可能会带来买家的悔恨。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Hmm, I’m beginning to feel buyer’s remorse from this leopard skin onesie. Seemed like such a good idea at the time.<br>嗯，我开始从这件豹皮连体衣中感受到买家的懊悔。在当时似乎是个好主意。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well it does look cozy, warm comfortable and relaxed, so I think if that’s what you wanted, it does the trick.<br>嗯，它看起来确实很舒适、温暖、舒适和放松，所以我认为如果这就是你想要的，它就可以了。</p>
<p>Dan(担)<br>Does the trick, meaning achieves the result you wanted.<br>做诀窍，意义达到你想要的结果。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK before Dan heads off to buy even more stuff he doesn’t need, please remember to check out our Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages.<br>好的，在 Dan 去买更多他不需要的东西之前，请记得查看我们的 Facebook、Twitter 和 YouTube 页面。</p>
<p>Both(双)<br>Bye!<br>再见！</p>
