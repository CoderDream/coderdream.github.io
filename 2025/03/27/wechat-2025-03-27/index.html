<h3 id="【英文脚本】"><a href="#【英文脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【英文脚本】"></a>【英文脚本】</h3><p>Georgie<br>Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Georgie.</p>
<p>Neil<br>And I’m Neil. In this programme we’re talking about the immune system, which is the body’s natural defence against getting ill. Now, Georgie, is there anything you do to boost your immune system?</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Yes. I try to eat lots of oranges, which apparently have lots of vitamin C, and there are lots of things people do to try to improve their immune system, and stay healthier, like eating certain foods, taking vitamins, or even activities like swimming in cold water. We’ll find out how useful some of these techniques are in today’s programme.</p>
<p>Neil<br>But first, Georgie, a question. We all know the common cold – now, that’s the illness that makes you cough and sneeze, have a sore throat and headache. But how many colds does the average adult get in the UK each year? Is it: a) 2-3? b) 4-5? Or c) 7-8?</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Eight would be a lot. I’m going to go with a) 2-3 colds a year.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out at the end of the programme if you’re right. Now, many people can become ill over the winter with diseases like colds, flu and Covid-19. Host of BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Health, James Gallagher, gathered some experts to talk about immune systems, and he started off by asking whether they’d had more illnesses than usual this winter.</p>
<p>James Gallagher<br>Hello! Hi. Right, how has everyone been this winter? Because I’ve had a rotten one and I have felt constantly ill since about November. John?</p>
<p>John Tregoning<br>I have not had anything yet, touch wood.</p>
<p>James Gallagher<br>OK, let’s see what I can infect you with by the end of the show. Margaret?</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney<br>I was pretty unwell in September. I had what I presume to be Covid. But I’ve been alright since, mild snuffles aside.</p>
<p>James Gallagher<br>Eleanor, I really need someone to back me up.</p>
<p>Eleanor Riley<br>No, sorry, I’ve been absolutely 100% tickety-boo.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Unlike James, Professor John Tregoning hasn’t been ill. John uses the expression touch wood, which is an informal phrase said in order to avoid bad luck.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Doctor Margaret McCartney was unwell in September but has only had a few snuffles since. Snuffles is an informal word used to describe minor illnesses that affect your nose. We can also say sniffles.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Host James is surprised that nobody has been ill, and says to Professor Eleanor Riley ‘back me up’. If you ask someone to back you up, you are asking for them to say something which supports your opinion.</p>
<p>Neil<br>But Eleanor has had a healthy winter too. She’s been tickety-boo, which is an informal phrase meaning everything’s fine or in good order.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Throughout the winter, many people try different techniques, like taking supplements or eating certain foods to boost their immune system, to improve their body’s natural defences against disease. Host of BBC Radio 4’s Inside Health, James Gallagher asks doctor Margaret McCartney whether some of these products are successful.</p>
<p>James Gallagher<br>OK quick-fire round Margaret. Echinacea?</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney<br>No.</p>
<p>James Gallagher<br>Turmeric?</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney<br>No.</p>
<p>James Gallagher<br>Ginger shots?</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney<br>No.</p>
<p>James Gallagher<br>This is a very, very good quiz! What about the stuff you squirt up your nose when you’re at the beginning of an infection?</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney<br>Interesting, but not any better than normal saline spray – just salt water.</p>
<p>Neil<br>In fact, according to Margaret, there isn’t enough evidence that many popular health products can actually change the way your immune system works.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Another popular health trend in the UK is cold water swimming. People who swim in cold water say it’s good for their mental health, and they also believe it makes them less likely to get ill during the winter months.</p>
<p>Neil<br>But scientists aren’t sure about the benefits of cold water swimming for the immune system yet, as Professor John Tregoning explains to BBC Radio 4’s Inside Health.</p>
<p>John Tregoning<br>The social element actually is really important. It probably is beneficial to do. You reduce stress and cortisol dampens the immune system, so actually if you’re stressed then maybe you are more prone to infection. And that may be why that benefit of being with people, nice people that you like in nice places, is helping. But I don’t think it’s unique to cold water swimming. I think you could probably get it from dancing or singing or going for a run.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>John says that cortisol, a chemical associated with stress, dampens the immune system. Here, dampens means makes weaker. We also have a common expression ‘dampen someone’s spirits’ which means to make them less enthusiastic about something.</p>
<p>Neil<br>John says that there is evidence that people who are stressed are more prone to infection. If you’re more prone to something, it’s more likely to happen to you.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>It could be that cold water swimming reduces stress, and so it helps people’s immune systems work well. But there are lots of other activities that could have the same effect, and help people have fewer colds over winter.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Which reminds me of my question, Georgie. I asked how many colds the average UK adult has a year.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>And I said 2-3.</p>
<p>Neil<br>And that is the correct answer, so well done!</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Thank you! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with touch wood, which is an expression used, often in speech, to avoid bad luck.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Snuffles, or sniffles, are minor illnesses that affect your nose.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>If you ask someone to back you up, you want them to say something to support your opinion.</p>
<p>Neil<br>The expression tickety-boo means fine and in good order.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>If you dampen something you make it weaker. And the expression dampen someone’s spirits means you make them less enthusiastic about something.</p>
<p>Neil<br>And if you’re more prone to something, it’s more likely to happen to you.</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Once again our 6 minutes are up, but you can test what you’ve learned with the free interactive quiz on our website.</p>
<p>Neil<br>Bye for now!</p>
<p>Georgie<br>Goodbye!</p>

<h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Georgie.<br>您好，这里是 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Georgie。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And I’m Neil. In this programme we’re talking about the immune system, which is the body’s natural defence against getting ill. Now, Georgie, is there anything you do to boost your immune system?<br>我是 Neil。在这个节目中，我们谈论的是免疫系统，这是身体防止生病的自然防御系统。现在，Georgie，您有什么方法可以增强您的免疫系统吗？</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Yes. I try to eat lots of oranges, which apparently have lots of vitamin C, and there are lots of things people do to try to improve their immune system, and stay healthier, like eating certain foods, taking vitamins, or even activities like swimming in cold water. We’ll find out how useful some of these techniques are in today’s programme.<br>是的。我试着吃很多橙子，橙子显然含有大量的维生素 C，人们会做很多事情来改善他们的免疫系统，保持更健康，比如吃某些食物、服用维生素，甚至是像在冷水中游泳这样的活动。我们将在今天的节目中了解其中一些技术有多大用处。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But first, Georgie, a question. We all know the common cold – now, that’s the illness that makes you cough and sneeze, have a sore throat and headache. But how many colds does the average adult get in the UK each year? Is it: a) 2-3? b) 4-5? Or c) 7-8?<br>但首先，Georgie，一个问题。我们都知道普通感冒 —— 现在，这种疾病会让你咳嗽和打喷嚏、喉咙痛和头痛。但是，在英国，普通成年人每年患多少次感冒呢？是：a） 2-3？b） 4-5？或者 c） 7-8？</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Eight would be a lot. I’m going to go with a) 2-3 colds a year.<br>八次会很多。我打算每年 2-3 次感冒。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out at the end of the programme if you’re right. Now, many people can become ill over the winter with diseases like colds, flu and Covid-19. Host of BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Health, James Gallagher, gathered some experts to talk about immune systems, and he started off by asking whether they’d had more illnesses than usual this winter.<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出您是否正确。现在，许多人会在冬天患上感冒、流感和 Covid-19 等疾病。BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的主持人 James Gallagher 召集了一些专家来谈论免疫系统，他首先询问他们今年冬天是否比平时患上了更多的疾病。</p>
<p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>Hello! Hi. Right, how has everyone been this winter? Because I’ve had a rotten one and I have felt constantly ill since about November. John?<br>你好！你好。对，这个冬天大家都过得怎么样？因为我有一个坏的，而且从大约 11 月开始我就一直感到不适。John？</p>
<p>John Tregoning(约翰·特雷戈宁)<br>I have not had anything yet, touch wood.<br>我还什么都没吃，摸摸木头。</p>
<p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>OK, let’s see what I can infect you with by the end of the show. Margaret?<br>好，让我们看看在节目结束时我能用什么感染你。玛格丽特？</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney(玛格丽特·麦卡特尼)<br>I was pretty unwell in September. I had what I presume to be Covid. But I’ve been alright since, mild snuffles aside.<br>9 月份我身体很不舒服。我得了我认为是 Covid 的东西。但从那以后我一直都没事，除了轻微的鼻息。</p>
<p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>Eleanor, I really need someone to back me up.<br>埃莉诺，我真的需要有人支持我。</p>
<p>Eleanor Riley(埃莉诺·莱利)<br>No, sorry, I’ve been absolutely 100% tickety-boo.<br>不，对不起，我绝对是 100% 的票务嘘声。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Unlike James, Professor John Tregoning hasn’t been ill. John uses the expression touch wood, which is an informal phrase said in order to avoid bad luck.<br>与詹姆斯不同，约翰·特雷戈宁教授没有生病。John 使用了 touch wood 这个表达，这是一个非正式的短语，以避免厄运。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Doctor Margaret McCartney was unwell in September but has only had a few snuffles since. Snuffles is an informal word used to describe minor illnesses that affect your nose. We can also say sniffles.<br>玛格丽特·麦卡特尼 （Margaret McCartney） 医生在 9 月份身体不适，但此后只抽了几次鼻涕。鼻烟是一个非正式词，用于描述影响鼻子的小病。我们也可以说 sniffles。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Host James is surprised that nobody has been ill, and says to Professor Eleanor Riley ‘back me up’. If you ask someone to back you up, you are asking for them to say something which supports your opinion.<br>主持人 James 对没有人生病感到惊讶，并对 Eleanor Riley 教授说“支持我”。如果你要求某人支持你，你就是在要求他们说一些支持你观点的东西。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But Eleanor has had a healthy winter too. She’s been tickety-boo, which is an informal phrase meaning everything’s fine or in good order.<br>但埃莉诺也度过了一个健康的冬天。她一直很 tickety-boo，这是一个非正式的短语，意思是一切都很好或井井有条。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Throughout the winter, many people try different techniques, like taking supplements or eating certain foods to boost their immune system, to improve their body’s natural defences against disease. Host of BBC Radio 4’s Inside Health, James Gallagher asks doctor Margaret McCartney whether some of these products are successful.<br>在整个冬天，许多人尝试不同的技术，例如服用补充剂或吃某些食物来增强免疫系统，以改善身体对疾病的自然防御能力。BBC Radio 4 的 Inside Health 主持人詹姆斯·加拉格尔 （James Gallagher） 询问医生玛格丽特·麦卡特尼 （Margaret McCartney） 这些产品是否成功了。</p>
<p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>OK quick-fire round Margaret. Echinacea?<br>好的，快速射击 Margaret。紫锥菊？</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney(玛格丽特·麦卡特尼)<br>No.<br>不。</p>
<p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>Turmeric?<br>姜黄？</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney(玛格丽特·麦卡特尼)<br>No.<br>不。</p>
<p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>Ginger shots?<br>姜汁？</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney(玛格丽特·麦卡特尼)<br>No.<br>不。</p>
<p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>This is a very, very good quiz! What about the stuff you squirt up your nose when you’re at the beginning of an infection?<br>这是一个非常非常好的测验！当你在感染开始时喷到鼻子里的东西呢？</p>
<p>Margaret McCartney(玛格丽特·麦卡特尼)<br>Interesting, but not any better than normal saline spray – just salt water.<br>有趣，但并不比普通的盐水喷雾好 —— 只是盐水。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>In fact, according to Margaret, there isn’t enough evidence that many popular health products can actually change the way your immune system works.<br>事实上，根据 Margaret 的说法，没有足够的证据表明许多流行的保健品实际上可以改变您的免疫系统的工作方式。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Another popular health trend in the UK is cold water swimming. People who swim in cold water say it’s good for their mental health, and they also believe it makes them less likely to get ill during the winter months.<br>英国另一个流行的健康趋势是冷水游泳。在冷水中游泳的人说这对他们的心理健康有好处，他们还认为这让他们在冬季不太可能生病。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But scientists aren’t sure about the benefits of cold water swimming for the immune system yet, as Professor John Tregoning explains to BBC Radio 4’s Inside Health.<br>但科学家们还不确定冷水游泳对免疫系统的好处，正如 John Tregoning 教授向 BBC Radio 4 的 Inside Health 解释的那样。</p>
<p>John Tregoning(约翰·特雷戈宁)<br>The social element actually is really important. It probably is beneficial to do. You reduce stress and cortisol dampens the immune system, so actually if you’re stressed then maybe you are more prone to infection. And that may be why that benefit of being with people, nice people that you like in nice places, is helping. But I don’t think it’s unique to cold water swimming. I think you could probably get it from dancing or singing or going for a run.<br>社交元素实际上真的很重要。这样做可能是有益的。你可以减轻压力，皮质醇会抑制免疫系统，所以实际上，如果你有压力，那么你可能更容易感染。这可能就是为什么在美好的地方与你喜欢的好人在一起的好处会有所帮助。但我不认为这是冷水游泳所独有的。我想你可能可以从跳舞、唱歌或跑步中获得它。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>John says that cortisol, a chemical associated with stress, dampens the immune system. Here, dampens means makes weaker. We also have a common expression ‘dampen someone’s spirits’ which means to make them less enthusiastic about something.<br>约翰说，皮质醇是一种与压力相关的化学物质，会抑制免疫系统。在这里，dampens 表示更弱。我们还有一个常见的表达方式 ‘dampen someone’s spirit“ ，意思是让他们对某事不那么热情。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>John says that there is evidence that people who are stressed are more prone to infection. If you’re more prone to something, it’s more likely to happen to you.<br>约翰说，有证据表明，压力大的人更容易感染。如果你更容易发生某事，它就更有可能发生在你身上。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>It could be that cold water swimming reduces stress, and so it helps people’s immune systems work well. But there are lots of other activities that could have the same effect, and help people have fewer colds over winter.<br>冷水游泳可以减轻压力，从而帮助人们的免疫系统正常工作。但是还有许多其他活动可以产生相同的效果，并帮助人们在冬天减少感冒。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Which reminds me of my question, Georgie. I asked how many colds the average UK adult has a year.<br>这让我想起了我的问题，Georgie。我问英国成年人平均一年有多少次感冒。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>And I said 2-3.<br>我说 2-3。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And that is the correct answer, so well done!<br>这就是正确答案，做得太好了！</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Thank you! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with touch wood, which is an expression used, often in speech, to avoid bad luck.<br>谢谢！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 touch wood 开始，这是一个经常用于语音的表达方式，以避免厄运。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Snuffles, or sniffles, are minor illnesses that affect your nose.<br>鼻涕或流鼻涕是影响鼻子的小病。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>If you ask someone to back you up, you want them to say something to support your opinion.<br>如果你要求某人支持你，你希望他们说些什么来支持你的观点。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The expression tickety-boo means fine and in good order.<br>“tickety-boo”一词的意思是“良好”和“井然有序”。</p>
<p>Georgie(乔治)<br>If you dampen something you make it weaker. And the expression dampen someone’s spirits means you make them less enthusiastic about something.<br>如果你抑制了某个东西，你就会让它变得更弱。而 dampen someone’s spirits 这句话的意思是你让他们对某事不那么热情。</p>
<p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And if you’re more prone to something, it’s more likely to happen to you.<br>如果你更容易发生某事，它就更有可能发生在你身上。</p>
